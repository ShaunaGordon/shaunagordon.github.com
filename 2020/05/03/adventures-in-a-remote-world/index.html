					<p>Among my many blog post drafts, I have a satirical piece that was originally intended to turn all the &ldquo;remote working is inferior [because it&rsquo;s a new thing with a learning curve]&rdquo; stuff on its head.</p>
<p>&hellip;And then COVID-19 happened and pretty much overnight, just about everyone suddenly had to do at least some things remotely (even if work wasn&rsquo;t one of them).</p>
<p>Schools are all now done in distance learning format (hat-tip to all of the school staff who busted their tails to make that pivot and get students of all ages going with relatively little disruption!). Zoom, Hangouts, and all the other video conference services are flooded with new people setting up every meeting, conference, non-meeting gathering, meetup, and social time under the sun. ISPs are getting bitch-slapped for not maintaining or upgrading their last-mile lines.</p>
<p>Suddenly, that satirical piece became kind of prophetic as the imagined &ldquo;remote is default&rdquo; scenario starts becoming more of the new normal.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve been a remote worker and an advocate of work cultures that focus on results, thereby allowing the people who <em>can</em> be location independent to <em>be</em> so, for several years now. As a result, I&rsquo;ve found myself in more or less a &ldquo;response team member&rdquo; position, where I help provide resources and be a rock for those who were just tossed into the deep end. Even in that position, and even with my experience as a remote worker, it&rsquo;s been fascinating to see how things changed for me and how I&rsquo;ve had to adjust, too, and it highlights just how much non-remote interaction even a 100% remote-working introvert like myself actually has.</p>
<p><a href="/2015/05/15/in-defense-of-remote-friendly-work-environments/#remote--isolated">As I&rsquo;ve addressed in the past,</a> there&rsquo;s a common misconception that being remote means holing up in your basement or something for days on end working on whatever it is you&rsquo;re working on. It harkens back to the old hacker stereotypes of the hoodied, lanky, teen or 20-something guy in a dark room with nothing but the glow of his computer monitor, surrounded by cans and bottles of Mountain Dew, Hot Pocket wrappers, and pizza boxes perhaps with a stale crust or two, furiously typing away at whatever project he&rsquo;s working on, only to emerge after several days or a week, his goal accomplished.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s how you remote, you&rsquo;re doing it wrong. Well&hellip;under the old normal circumstances, at least.</p>
<p><img src="http://readeroffictions.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gif-what-matrix.gif" alt="The Matrix&rsquo;s Neo in his apartment taking off his headphones, asking &ldquo;what?&rdquo;"></p>
<p>The reality for me was that I had a standing weekly lunch with some friends, a biweekly in-person D&amp;D campaign, and whenever schedules and interests aligned, in-person meetups a couple of times a month, as well as the less-frequent conferences and holiday celebrations, and the ad-hoc lunches or happy hours with friends or general networking meetings. In short, I had/have a pretty vibrant social life.</p>
<p>I also enjoyed my days where I was the only one at home, or it was just my husband and me, because the kiddo was off at school, or they were out doing stuff.</p>
<p>All of that shifted in an instant, which turned out to be more of shock than I had anticipated (it probably didn&rsquo;t help that I now have to also make sure the kiddo is keeping up with his school work). All of a sudden, <em>the option</em> to meet up with friends or even the simple idea of activities like &ldquo;going to the movies&rdquo; or &ldquo;taking the family bowling&rdquo; was off the table. Hell, even things like doctors appointments and grocery shopping suddenly got a hell of a lot more complicated, and even something as simple as donating a couple of PPE items turned into several days of coordination.</p>
<h2 id="adapting-to-the-new-normal">Adapting To The New Normal&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#adapting-to-the-new-normal"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>Despite all of that, my day-to-day life has actually started to de-stress, now that the main upheaval of active change is starting to settle down and the new routines are starting to form. And to be honest, a lot of it is really positive.</p>
<p>It helps that the weather is finally reliably improving. Here in Ohio, we&rsquo;re pretty much past the point of the weather going &ldquo;you know what? Just for shits and giggles, I&rsquo;m going to dip us into the 10 and 20 degree Fahrenheit range (subzero for my Celsius friends) for a day or two.&rdquo; It still gets chilly and in that &ldquo;just a little above freezing&rdquo; mark at night (and&hellip;you know&hellip;tornado season&hellip;because Midwest), but we&rsquo;re seeing more sunny days and the temperature average is creeping into the mid-50s (10+ C).</p>
<p><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/8f/ff/e9/8fffe96a8a15f44647e1a8663b050ff0--ohio-place.jpg" alt="A week in Ohio. Monday, nice weather. Tuesday, flooding. Wednesday, tornado. Thursday, snow."></p>
<p><small>Welcome to the northern Midwest in general.</small></p>
<p>This means doing things outside <em>is</em> an option &ndash; and my son and I have been taking advantage of it. We took this opportunity to work on riding his bike without training wheels, which is a pretty big deal to him (so big of a deal, he&rsquo;s practically shouting it from the rooftops). <em>That</em> has opened up a whole world of fun science-related YouTube channels, like <a href="https://youtube.com/user/minutephysics">Minutephysics</a>, in which I found a spectacular demonstration of the mechanics of bicycles and how they stay up. For a logic-oriented kid like mine, this was a big key in helping him understand what <em>can</em> make the bike fall over and that as long as he can keep himself centered, it probably won&rsquo;t, because bikes are built with quite a few features that make them try to stay upright as long as they&rsquo;re moving (TIL).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been able to enjoy a sort of &ldquo;life slowdown,&rdquo; overall. Gone is the feeling of needing to do all of the things <em>right now</em> and the general fast pace of (sub)urban life. Between the reduced need/ability to go just about anywhere, and the benefits of manual forms of transportation, even the (local) world seems to have largely slowed and calmed down. It doesn&rsquo;t feel so weird now to be tending to my garden in the morning or at lunch, like I&rsquo;m the odd one in the area, because more people in general are getting outside <em>to do literally anything</em> that they can.</p>
<h2 id="redefining-productivity">Redefining Productivity&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#redefining-productivity"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>One of the first things we learned as an <a href="https://www.choosefi.com/distance-education-se012/">&ldquo;accidental homeshooler&rdquo;</a> family was that you <em>really</em> can&rsquo;t do a 1:1 replication of the brick-and-mortar school day. It&rsquo;s just not going to happen. The 7-hour school day is the way it is pretty much solely to play the cat-herding game that is dealing with groups of 30 kids (especially at the elementary level). When your kid can work through the content at their own pace, it will take them however long it takes <em>them</em> to do it. That might be 2 hours or it might be 12. And if it takes 2 hours, don&rsquo;t try to pile another 5 onto them. It&rsquo;s not going to turn out well.</p>
<p>Besides, kids learn all the time from pretty much everything &ndash; including boredom and learning to self-entertain. Having nothing to do isn&rsquo;t a bad thing for a kid. That said, if you want to give them something educational to do, have a look a <a href="https://www.choosefi.com/home-schooling-se06/">interest-led learning</a>, where you give them something to do based on something they already enjoy. By doing so, you can guide them toward learning a wealth of different topics, while they have fun doing what they love. (See also: the aforementioned physics lessons from bike riding.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also changed how I have personally approached productivity. Even while working remotely in normal circumstances, I still treated the weekdays as &ldquo;time to work.&rdquo; This was partially a practicality thing, because that&rsquo;s when kiddo was at school and the husband was also working. Outside of the &ldquo;normal business hours,&rdquo; the house activity reached a point where I could no longer work very well. Likewise, &ldquo;work&rdquo; frequently translated to &ldquo;the stuff that gets me paid either now or at some point in the future,&rdquo; and I actively tried to ensure I clocked 6 hours of &ldquo;productive&rdquo; time each day. (Yes, 6 and not 8, because that&rsquo;s actually what <em>most</em> knowledge/office workers <em>actually</em> work on &ldquo;real&rdquo; work. The other two generally consists of watercooler chat, refocusing from interruptions, small breaks, and general <a href="https://hbr.org/2004/10/presenteeism-at-work-but-out-of-it">presenteeism</a> for various reasons, among other things.)</p>
<p>Surprisingly, that had to change, too, and interestingly, it seems to have brought my actual habits, goals, etc <em>more</em> in line with my ideals about how work is supposed to work and how productivity for a high-tech worker like myself <em>actually</em> works.</p>
<p>The stressors of the pandemic, plus a number of stressors in my own life that predate it, have left me running pretty much at <a href="https://laura.mosher.tech/2020/04/07/comic-the-mana-theory/">a max of half mana</a> for the better part of the past six months or so and <em>really</em> screwed with my executive functioning&hellip;and ultimately shining a <em>giant spotlight</em> on the fact that I apparently have ADD (not the hyperactive kind, the good old fashioned &ldquo;can&rsquo;t stay focused for shit&rdquo; kind; I&rsquo;ll get into the details on that in another post at some point). Combined, everything has forced me to revamp&hellip;well&hellip;my entire ~day~ life.</p>
<p>Most people probably won&rsquo;t have to go to <em>that</em> kind of extreme, but most of the changes have revolved around redefining what &ldquo;productivity&rdquo; actually <em>looks like</em>.</p>
<p>Hint: it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;spend 6 hours every week day working for pay&rdquo; anymore.</p>
<p>Instead, I&rsquo;m using the <a href="https://maketime.blog/article/calendar-template/">MakeTime calendar template</a> to outline my &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; day (what I&rsquo;d like to do with different blocks of time). While the general idea of the blocks is pretty much the same as what I&rsquo;m already doing, the afternoon options are just as much &ldquo;do something not related to coding&rdquo; (which includes doing my adjunct work or helping kiddo with his work or even doing my own professional development) as they are &ldquo;do more coding,&rdquo; because my mornings seem to be the best time for deep coding work, generally. Things like teaching kiddo to ride a bike, or tending to my garden also count (because health and food), as does doing the household finances.</p>
<p>In short, &ldquo;productivity&rdquo; is no longer just about currency, but what I can do to keep <em>life in general</em> running. And some days, that means doing things that aren&rsquo;t tied to a paycheck of some sort, <strong>and that&rsquo;s okay.</strong></p>
<h3 id="but-i-need-all-those-hours-to-get-paycheck-work-done">But I Need All Those Hours To Get Paycheck Work Done!&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#but-i-need-all-those-hours-to-get-paycheck-work-done"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h3>
<p>Are you sure about that? Like, <em>really, really</em> sure? Because research and <a href="https://impossiblehq.com/parkinsons-law/">Parkinson&rsquo;s Law</a> state otherwise.</p>
<p>Try it. Focus less on filling X number of hours and instead create time boxes and focus on what you can get done <em>in that particular time block.</em> Pomodoro type timers work great for jumping into this.</p>
<p>If you do it for a week or two and still need all the extra hours and the &ldquo;extra&rdquo; work isn&rsquo;t from other extenuating circumstances, then you can go back to it (though you may also want to consider whether your workload is reasonable for your position in general; <em>most</em> people don&rsquo;t actually fill the standard 8ish hour day with &ldquo;productive&rdquo; work). No harm, no foul.</p>
<h2 id="getting-creative">Getting Creative&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#getting-creative"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>As I&rsquo;m writing this, I&rsquo;m sitting in one of my (now three) hammocks, which I strung up to the rafters of my covered porch. It provides me with a change of scenery when my office walls start to proverbially close in on me from the sheer amount of time I spend in it. It also lets me <em>enjoy</em> this nicer weather, even while I&rsquo;m working.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been working on my garden, which was something I planned long before all this, but I adapted when things started changing. I had started a number of plants from seed using the usual method of &ldquo;plant a few in each spot and thin later.&rdquo; Normally, &ldquo;thinning&rdquo; generally assumes that you discard the plants that don&rsquo;t look as hardy, but that would have been <em>a lot</em> of plants wasted in a time of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Screw that. I&rsquo;ll take an extra bushel or three of tomatoes if it means that much less of a food supply chain I have to worry about it. (The perks of having grown up in the Appalachian region &ndash; canning and dehydrating and whatnot are things I can fall back on without a second thought.)</p>
<p>But&hellip;that did mean I needed more peat pots for all these sprouts. Thankfully, Lowe&rsquo;s still had them, but they didn&rsquo;t have the containers to put them in to keep them from drying out too quickly (or to keep water from going everywhere), and I had already used the spare one I had picked up earlier. Welp&hellip;guess I&rsquo;m using the lid of the kit I had started with.</p>
<p>&hellip;And the Rubbermaid containers I happen to have nearby, so I can get the new set of pots up to the grow light.</p>

					<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>I make stuff.</p>
<p>My profession is problem solving. My chosen tool by which to do that has been developing software. I&rsquo;ve written shell scripts, maintained systems in .Net, built APIs in PHP, and implemented interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I&rsquo;ve maintained legacy systems and built cutting-edge, life-changing applications, as well as created little tools to support other people in getting their work done.</p>
<p>Writing software isn&rsquo;t all I do, though. I like to write English words, too, and my writing is about as eclectic as my coding. While my blog started (ages ago) as a &ldquo;tech and work blog,&rdquo; it soon expanded out to other aspects of life, including personal finance and the broader culture. Maybe I&rsquo;ll spin some topics off to their own blogs, eventually.</p>
<p>Professionally, I&rsquo;ve been a software developer for over a decade, with particular focus in full stack, PHP-based (and more recently, Python-based) web development. I&rsquo;ve also picked up professional teaching over the past year or so. For more details about my experience, <a href="http://resume.shaunagordon.com/">visit my resume</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, I&rsquo;ve embraced what seems to be my fate as an independent consultant and I run my own software development shop, World Tree Limited, through which I provide various development services and plan to release my own software products.</p>
<p>Culture means a great deal to me, so it should come as no surprise that I hold it above all else when working with organizations and I have a fair number of words to say about the current broader culture here in the US, and they go hand-in-hand. I&rsquo;m a staunch advocate of equitable culture, both inside and outside the (proverbial or literal) office, and I&rsquo;m not afraid to lose &ldquo;opportunities&rdquo; (though I&rsquo;d argue such things are not my kind of opportunities) because of it.</p>
<p>Maybe that makes me <a href="https://unemployable.com/podcast/intro/">&ldquo;unemployable&rdquo;</a>?</p>
<p>Or perhaps it&rsquo;s a criticism of conventional workplaces and I&rsquo;ve just been <a href="https://www.gorowe.com/">ahead of the curve</a>?</p>
<p>&#x1f937;&zwj;&#x2640;&#xfe0f;</p>
<p>Regardless, it gives my mind the never-ending puzzle of finding better ways of supporting my family.</p>

<p>(Ways I Make Money From This Site)</p>
<h2 id="i-hate-ads">I <em>Hate</em> Ads&hellip;</h2>
<p>I do, with a passion. The first extension I install on any browser is AdBlock. That&rsquo;s how much I hate them. I also hate when blogs write a &ldquo;review&rdquo; or other article for the sole purpose of selling that product. You know the kind I&rsquo;m talking about. They read like a commercial and are full of keywords and buzzwords about the product. I can usually spot them a mile away and they annoy the crap out of me.</p>
<h2 id="and-paywalls">&hellip;And Paywalls&hellip;</h2>
<p>I also hate when content is stuck behind a paywall for no good reason. The primary purpose of my blog is to share my knowledge with my audience. While I have no problem with the &ldquo;freemium&rdquo; (or even just premium) model for applications, I&rsquo;m not keen on them for article-based sites &ndash; at least not for mine. I think information is best shared freely, especially when it comes to some of the topics I cover.</p>
<h2 id="but-running-blogs-cost-resources">&hellip;But Running Blogs Cost Resources</h2>
<p>It does, however, take time, money, brainpower, equipment, etc. (ie - resources) to write my posts and maintain this and my other sites. The holy grail of arguably any hobby is for it to pay for itself. Now, obviously, brainpower (mental energy) isn&rsquo;t a currency society can deal in (how cool would that be, though? And I&rsquo;m still waiting for the tech that would allow me to just download my stream of consciousness to my computer), but hosting and keeping my domain name do require monetary resources. As a result, I offer (and may, in the future offer more) various ways to help defray these costs.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-make-money">How I Make Money</h2>
<p>Since I don&rsquo;t do ads, and I don&rsquo;t do paywalls, I need to implement other avenues from which to bring in money. Those methods are detailed below.</p>
<p>All methods are completely optional and you are under no obligation to use any of them or give me anything. The hope, though, is that the content of my site (or maybe some other interaction you&rsquo;ve had with me) has provided you with such value that you <em>want</em> to give back somehow, and in those situations, I want to make it easy for you to do so.</p>
<p>Oh, and <strong>10% of my income goes to a charity or project each month.</strong> More about that later.</p>
<h3 id="donations">Donations</h3>
<p>An easy way to give back is simply giving money. You&rsquo;re free to donate whatever amount you wish. You can do that via <a href="https://ko-fi.com/shaunagordon">my Ko-fi page</a> for one-time payments, or via <a href="https://liberapay.com/Dreamwalker-Collective/">my Liberapay</a> page for recurring payments.</p>
<h3 id="affiliate-program">Affiliate Program</h3>
<p>Another way to give back is to purchase things through my affiliate program. If I have something available that you are looking to buy, simply buy it through me, and I get a cut of the purchase at no extra cost to you.</p>
<p>This differs from ads in that the items and brands available via the affiliate program are ones that I&rsquo;ve used myself and would recommend. Additionally, they will only be linked to when I&rsquo;m actually talking about them. I figure that if I&rsquo;m going to review things and recommend them to my audience, anyway, I might as well provide them via an affiliate program.</p>
<h3 id="selling-my-own-things-directly">Selling My Own Things, Directly</h3>
<p>I sell some of my own things, as well, since I have a couple other hobbies. The funds from those things help pay for my sites, as well (as well as meatspace supplies as needed).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://leanpub.com/u/ShaunaGordon">Leanpub</a></li>
<li><a href="http://worldtreefarms.com">Soap Store</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(And Indirectly)</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also a gamer and like to tinker with <em>World of Warcraft</em> addons, in particular, but I technically can&rsquo;t make money from them directly (ie - I can&rsquo;t sell them), hence the name on the Liberapay account. <a href="https://dreamwalker-collective.github.io/">You can find those projects here.</a></p>
<h2 id="giving-back">Giving Back</h2>
<p>As I mentioned previously, <strong>10% of my income is donated each month.</strong> This is 10% off the top of my after-tax income, before other expenses.</p>
<p>To whom I choose to donate in a given month is somewhat random (it&rsquo;s who I decide to donate to that month), and whether it&rsquo;s an official non-profit organization isn&rsquo;t of particular concern, because I&rsquo;m not doing it for the tax write-off. Instead, I do it for the sake of giving back. I work with a lot of open source software, and am part of a number of communities that would benefit from a little financial backing. So, I do what I can to show my thanks and help support them.</p>
<p>What projects/organizations do I donate to? Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)</li>
<li>Apache Foundation</li>
<li>Ansible</li>
<li>Vagrant</li>
<li>American Foundation for Suicide Prevention</li>
<li>Trevor Project</li>
<li>Autism Self Advocacy Network</li>
<li>GoFundMe campaigns (usually for someone facing a hardship)</li>
<li>PCOS Foundation</li>
<li>Do Yoga With Me</li>
<li>Kickstarter projects, including:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1035100786/truenorth-php-woolly-mammoth-plush-toy">True North PHP</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2022042435/bula-batiki-coconut-oil-non-profit-from-the-fiji-i">The community of Bula Batiki, Fiji</a>, who are building sustainable income through the export of coconut oil</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1593368264/blessed-designs-ethically-made-t-shirts">Blessed Designs</a>, a trio of women of color starting a sustainably- and ethically-made (and comfy!) clothing company</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ankacoop/empowering-syrian-refugees-with-handcrafted-heirlo">Anka Cooperative</a>, empowering Syrian refugees by employing and training them to make hand-woven rugs</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/radian/the-perfect-everyday-jeans">Radian Jeans</a>, because pockets!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&hellip;and many others</li>
</ul>
<p>So, by helping me fund my projects, you&rsquo;ll also be helping me fund many other projects. :)</p>

                    <h1 id="hiring-me">Hiring Me</h1>
<p>Looking to work with me? Cool! Let&rsquo;s start with the type of relationship.</p>
<h2 id="what-type">What Type?</h2>
<h3 id="conventional-employment">Conventional Employment</h3>
<p>So you read through that &#x261d;&#xfe0f; and still want to hire me as a conventional employee? Well&hellip;it didn&rsquo;t scare you away, so that&rsquo;s a start.</p>
<p>For my sake and yours, I have a high bar for conventional employment in particular. Let&rsquo;s put it this way: I&rsquo;ve turned down Amazon roughly half a dozen times at this point.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;ll want to start by reading the posts in <a href="/tags/culture/">the &ldquo;culture&rdquo; tag</a>. Ideally, you&rsquo;ll want to read most of my blog, though the <a href="/categories/business/">business category</a> might be most relevant to you (ostensibly a recruiter or businessperson of some sort).</p>
<p>I also expect to get paid what I&rsquo;m worth. Don&rsquo;t bother sending me leads unless the base compensation is six figures.</p>
<p>Oh, and location-independent. I&rsquo;m not interested in relocating (so please don&rsquo;t ask), and while I don&rsquo;t mind going into the office periodically (after this whole Covid thing gets worked out; and what &ldquo;periodically&rdquo; means will depend on where &ldquo;the office&rdquo; is), I do best working where I&rsquo;m most productive.</p>
<p>I also have this snazzy office of my own, and I&rsquo;d hate for it to go to waste. &#x1f609;</p>
<h3 id="independent-consulting">Independent Consulting</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got some work that needs done, but don&rsquo;t need a full time employee for it? Awesome! Let&rsquo;s see if we&rsquo;re a fit!</p>
<p>First of all, let me make it clear: <strong>I run a business,</strong> I am <em>not</em> a &ldquo;contractor,&rdquo; especially when that means &ldquo;employee in all but name&rdquo; (aka &ldquo;defacto employee,&rdquo; which is questionably legal, by the way). The relationship is a business-to-business one. I may be one person, but the arrangement is like that of an agency. I control my time, location, and equipment (though I am flexible on where code lives for compliance purposes and whatnot, and of course meetings are part of the relationship).</p>
<p>Still with me? Cool. Let&rsquo;s talk business.</p>
<p>Because I generally do large projects where scopes are subject to changing, I typically bill by the hour. The logistics are flexible, though, and I generally do one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase set number of hours &ndash; this is useful for knocking out a backlog or other shorter-term situation</li>
<li>A time-boxed contract without set hours &ndash; this is typically the best for large projects where either I supply the team or I&rsquo;m embedded in your team</li>
</ul>
<p>Both contracts are renewable/extendable (subject to availability), because expectations inevitably change over time, and pricing is determined by the services required and the nature of the relationship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also open to the &ldquo;purchase hours&rdquo; part on a retainer basis.</p>
<h2 id="still-works-for-you-lets-talk">Still Works For You? Let&rsquo;s Talk</h2>
<p>The best way to get in touch is via one of the communication options at the top of the page.</p>
<p>To save us both time, please be sure to include the important information about the work you need &ndash; things like tech stack, scope of work, and timeline requirements are super helpful in gauging whether we&rsquo;ll be a technical fit.</p>
<p>For conventional employement, please include pay range and benefit information.</p>
<p>In all cases, down-in-the-weeds details aren&rsquo;t required, just that 10,000-foot view will be sufficient to start.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you!</p>

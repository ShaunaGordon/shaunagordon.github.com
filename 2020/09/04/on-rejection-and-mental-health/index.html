					<p>I was turned down for a job today.</p>
<p>This is nothing new. I&rsquo;ve been turned down for jobs before. Hell, I&rsquo;ve done the job hunt thing on a near-annual basis, which pretty much inevitably results in at least one application rejection per cycle. I&rsquo;ve had so many that I&rsquo;ve dealt with such rejections at nearly every step of the process.</p>
<p>There weren&rsquo;t even a lot of stakes for this job. I wasn&rsquo;t looking (and was even actively <em>not</em> looking) when it fell into my lap. I didn&rsquo;t even <em>need</em> the job (which changed the entire feel of the interviews even more than I anticipated).</p>
<p>Would it have been a neat place to work and a good growth opportunity? Sure. Will not getting it put me in some kind of bind? Nope. I&rsquo;m in probably the most financially secure position I&rsquo;ve been in my entire adult life, and that was even one of the reasons I considered <em>not</em> pursuing the opportunity to begin with (not to mention giving me a <em>lot</em> of leverage when choosing to pursue it).</p>
<p>Hell, after not hearing anything for a couple of weeks (that was anticipated/understood), I was actually starting to kick around the idea of <em>turning it down</em>, because I was tired of being in limbo and just wanted to keep doing my thing, where I had no shortage of work. This bit was probably helped by the fact that a mutual connection reached out to me about a month ago and inadvertantly let it slip that &ldquo;it didn&rsquo;t work out&rdquo; between me and the opportunity. So I knew it was very likely coming. I&rsquo;d even had a fair bit of time to process through the possibility.</p>
<h2 id="and-yet">And yet&hellip;&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#and-yet"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>&hellip;when I got the typical response of &ldquo;they really loved you, but decided to go with a different candidate,&rdquo; it hurt. &ldquo;Stung&rdquo; was the word I used from the outset. Because that&rsquo;s about what it felt like.</p>
<p>And more than that, it put me into a funk for the entire rest of the afternoon and into the evening. I lost <em>all</em> motivation to do&hellip;basically anything. I couldn&rsquo;t even work up the gumption to write this until after medication, a bike ride, and couple of hours in bed playing a puzzle game. Even now, I don&rsquo;t really <em>feel</em> like doing this, but I know I process better when I do&hellip;and it&rsquo;s still taking me going back to that puzzled game to &ldquo;recenter&rdquo; as I write this.</p>
<p>I know what I&rsquo;d tell me if this were one of the groups I&rsquo;m a member of &ndash; you&rsquo;re mourning the lost opportunity and potential and <em>that&rsquo;s okay.</em> And it is okay&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;except it&rsquo;s not grief. Yeah, it was a lost opportunity and lost potential, but my disappointment about <em>that</em> is about the level of missing the grand prize on a carnival game, or this:</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/811/090/3b4.gif" alt="Harrison Ford as Han Solo giving a &ldquo;hmm, oh well&rdquo; reaction as he turns back to hotwiring the door"></p>
<p>Instead, it was <em>the being rejected itself</em> that got to me.</p>
<h2 id="rejection-sensitive-dysphoria">Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#rejection-sensitive-dysphoria"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>I still need to write about this as its own thing, but I not-yet-officially have ADD/ADHD &ndash; brought to totally dysfunctional levels by the fallout from the pandemic (for better or worse). Apparently with it (and potentially with Autism, so that&rsquo;s fun, too) comes something called <a href="https://blackgirllostkeys.com/adhd/adhd-rejection-sensitive-dysphoria/"><em>rejection sensitive dysphoria</em></a>.</p>
<p>You know that whole &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a perfectionist&rdquo; thing some people will use as a response to that &ldquo;what&rsquo;s your biggest flaw&rdquo; BS interview question? That&rsquo;s one I used to genuinely use (I am &ndash; or at least used to be &ndash; a perfectionist to a fault), and apparently it&rsquo;s a symptom of RSD.</p>
<p>Now, being a perfectionist by itself isn&rsquo;t necessarily indicative of RSD (though I&rsquo;d venture to guess that perfectionism is indicative of <em>something</em> bigger going on in the vast majority of cases), but when <a href="https://www.littlemisslionheart.com/rejection-sensitive-dysphoria-adhd/">coupled with other things</a> like &ldquo;people pleasing to avoid criticism&rdquo; and &ldquo;tend to assume no one likes you&rdquo; and &ldquo;getting overwhelmed by feeling someone is upset with you or doesn&rsquo;t like you&rdquo; and &ldquo;have strong emotional reactions to criticism (like crying),&rdquo; well&hellip;</p>
<p>Check, check, check, and&hellip;oh yeah, check.</p>
<p>Suddenly a <em>lot</em> of things make sense.</p>
<p>That perfectionism was a learned response from the intersection of the high sensitivity of RSD and an emotionally abusive childhood. I had no words available to describe the level of pain I experienced (RSD wasn&rsquo;t even a known thing at that time), plus getting told I&rsquo;m just &ldquo;thin-skinned,&rdquo; meant the only real coping mechanism I had was to do everything I could to not give people reasons to criticise me &ndash; to be perfect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always felt that I wasn&rsquo;t <em>allowed</em> to be anything less than perfect. To this day, that&rsquo;s something I still fight with. It&rsquo;s honestly one of the reasons I love weight lifting and test-driven development so much &ndash; they reframe &ldquo;failure&rdquo; to something not just not-negative (there&rsquo;s no moral judgement to their messages of failure, it&rsquo;s a purely mechanical &ldquo;nope&rdquo;), but actually <em>positive</em>. In both, growth and improvement happen most at the point of failure, be it at muscle failure &ndash; when no amount of determination will help you lift that barbell even a fraction of an inch &ndash; or at red tests identifying missing pieces that need added.</p>
<h2 id="now-what">Now What?&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#now-what"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>Honestly? Fuck if I know, at least on the ADD/ADHD/RSD front. Just knowing and having the words/framework goes a <em>super</em> long way for me in understanding and accepting certain things, and I&rsquo;ve already been going down this road of shedding that perfectionism and people-pleasing stuff, and otherwise unknowingly creating healthier coping mechanisms. I learned some time ago that my life is much more enjoyable and with much less stress if I just do my thing and if people like it, great.</p>
<p>For the work thing, it seems The Universe Has Spoken and freelancing/doing my own thing is my career path, too. I mean&hellip;I <em>am</em> coming up on my second anniversary of being freelance, putting it in the upper echelons of my work tenures with any one arrangement, it really doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s been that long, and this experience has shown me that I still <em>want</em> my work arrangement to be like this and I still <em>want</em> to keep doing what I&rsquo;m doing &ndash; even <em>if</em> that means I need to be more mindful about structuring my day better.</p>

					<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>I make stuff.</p>
<p>My profession is problem solving. My chosen tool by which to do that has been developing software. I&rsquo;ve written shell scripts, maintained systems in .Net, built APIs in PHP, and implemented interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I&rsquo;ve maintained legacy systems and built cutting-edge, life-changing applications, as well as created little tools to support other people in getting their work done.</p>
<p>Writing software isn&rsquo;t all I do, though. I like to write English words, too, and my writing is about as eclectic as my coding. While my blog started (ages ago) as a &ldquo;tech and work blog,&rdquo; it soon expanded out to other aspects of life, including personal finance and the broader culture. Maybe I&rsquo;ll spin some topics off to their own blogs, eventually.</p>
<p>Professionally, I&rsquo;ve been a software developer for over a decade, with particular focus in full stack, PHP-based (and more recently, Python-based) web development. I&rsquo;ve also picked up professional teaching over the past year or so. For more details about my experience, <a href="http://resume.shaunagordon.com/">visit my resume</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, I&rsquo;ve embraced what seems to be my fate as an independent consultant and I run my own software development shop, World Tree Limited, through which I provide various development services and plan to release my own software products.</p>
<p>Culture means a great deal to me, so it should come as no surprise that I hold it above all else when working with organizations and I have a fair number of words to say about the current broader culture here in the US, and they go hand-in-hand. I&rsquo;m a staunch advocate of equitable culture, both inside and outside the (proverbial or literal) office, and I&rsquo;m not afraid to lose &ldquo;opportunities&rdquo; (though I&rsquo;d argue such things are not my kind of opportunities) because of it.</p>
<p>Maybe that makes me <a href="https://unemployable.com/podcast/intro/">&ldquo;unemployable&rdquo;</a>?</p>
<p>Or perhaps it&rsquo;s a criticism of conventional workplaces and I&rsquo;ve just been <a href="https://www.gorowe.com/">ahead of the curve</a>?</p>
<p>&#x1f937;&zwj;&#x2640;&#xfe0f;</p>
<p>Regardless, it gives my mind the never-ending puzzle of finding better ways of supporting my family.</p>

<p>(Ways I Make Money From This Site)</p>
<h2 id="i-hate-ads">I <em>Hate</em> Ads&hellip;</h2>
<p>I do, with a passion. The first extension I install on any browser is AdBlock. That&rsquo;s how much I hate them. I also hate when blogs write a &ldquo;review&rdquo; or other article for the sole purpose of selling that product. You know the kind I&rsquo;m talking about. They read like a commercial and are full of keywords and buzzwords about the product. I can usually spot them a mile away and they annoy the crap out of me.</p>
<h2 id="and-paywalls">&hellip;And Paywalls&hellip;</h2>
<p>I also hate when content is stuck behind a paywall for no good reason. The primary purpose of my blog is to share my knowledge with my audience. While I have no problem with the &ldquo;freemium&rdquo; (or even just premium) model for applications, I&rsquo;m not keen on them for article-based sites &ndash; at least not for mine. I think information is best shared freely, especially when it comes to some of the topics I cover.</p>
<h2 id="but-running-blogs-cost-resources">&hellip;But Running Blogs Cost Resources</h2>
<p>It does, however, take time, money, brainpower, equipment, etc. (ie - resources) to write my posts and maintain this and my other sites. The holy grail of arguably any hobby is for it to pay for itself. Now, obviously, brainpower (mental energy) isn&rsquo;t a currency society can deal in (how cool would that be, though? And I&rsquo;m still waiting for the tech that would allow me to just download my stream of consciousness to my computer), but hosting and keeping my domain name do require monetary resources. As a result, I offer (and may, in the future offer more) various ways to help defray these costs.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-make-money">How I Make Money</h2>
<p>Since I don&rsquo;t do ads, and I don&rsquo;t do paywalls, I need to implement other avenues from which to bring in money. Those methods are detailed below.</p>
<p>All methods are completely optional and you are under no obligation to use any of them or give me anything. The hope, though, is that the content of my site (or maybe some other interaction you&rsquo;ve had with me) has provided you with such value that you <em>want</em> to give back somehow, and in those situations, I want to make it easy for you to do so.</p>
<p>Oh, and <strong>10% of my income goes to a charity or project each month.</strong> More about that later.</p>
<h3 id="donations">Donations</h3>
<p>An easy way to give back is simply giving money. You&rsquo;re free to donate whatever amount you wish. You can do that via <a href="https://ko-fi.com/shaunagordon">my Ko-fi page</a> for one-time payments, or via <a href="https://liberapay.com/Dreamwalker-Collective/">my Liberapay</a> page for recurring payments.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/ShaunaGordon">sponsor me through Github</a>, either one-time or on a recurring basis.</p>
<h3 id="selling-my-own-things-directly">Selling My Own Things, Directly</h3>
<p>I sell some of my own things, as well, since I have a couple other hobbies. The funds from those things help pay for my sites, as well (as well as meatspace supplies as needed).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://leanpub.com/u/ShaunaGordon">Leanpub</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(And Indirectly)</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also a gamer and like to tinker with <em>World of Warcraft</em> addons, in particular, but I technically can&rsquo;t make money from them directly (ie - I can&rsquo;t sell them), hence the name on the Liberapay account. <a href="https://dreamwalker-collective.github.io/">You can find those projects here.</a></p>
<h2 id="giving-back">Giving Back</h2>
<p>As I mentioned previously, 10% of my income is donated each month.</p>
<p>To whom I choose to donate in a given month is somewhat random (it&rsquo;s who I decide to donate to that month), and whether it&rsquo;s an official non-profit organization isn&rsquo;t of particular concern, because I&rsquo;m not doing it for the tax write-off. Instead, I do it for the sake of giving back. I work with a lot of open source software, and am part of a number of communities that would benefit from a little financial backing. So, I do what I can to show my thanks and help support them.</p>
<p>What projects/organizations do I donate to? Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)</li>
<li>Apache Foundation</li>
<li>Ansible</li>
<li>Vagrant</li>

<p>Looking to work with me? Cool! Let&rsquo;s start with the type of relationship.</p>
<h2 id="what-type">What Type?</h2>
<h3 id="conventional-employment">Conventional Employment</h3>
<p>So you read through that &#x261d;&#xfe0f; and still want to hire me as a conventional employee? Well&hellip;it didn&rsquo;t scare you away, so that&rsquo;s a start.</p>
<p>For my sake and yours, I have a high bar for conventional employment in particular. Let&rsquo;s put it this way: I&rsquo;ve turned down Amazon roughly half a dozen times at this point.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;ll want to start by reading the posts in <a href="/tags/culture/">the &ldquo;culture&rdquo; tag</a>. Ideally, you&rsquo;ll want to read most of my blog, though the <a href="/categories/business/">business category</a> might be most relevant to you (ostensibly a recruiter or businessperson of some sort).</p>
<p>I also expect to get paid what I&rsquo;m worth. Don&rsquo;t bother sending me leads unless the base compensation is six figures.</p>
<p>Oh, and location-independent. I&rsquo;m not interested in relocating (so please don&rsquo;t ask), and while I don&rsquo;t mind going into the office periodically (after this whole Covid thing gets worked out; and what &ldquo;periodically&rdquo; means will depend on where &ldquo;the office&rdquo; is), I do best working where I&rsquo;m most productive.</p>
<p>I also have this snazzy office of my own, and I&rsquo;d hate for it to go to waste. &#x1f609;</p>
<h3 id="independent-consulting">Independent Consulting</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got some work that needs done, but don&rsquo;t need a full time employee for it? Awesome! Let&rsquo;s see if we&rsquo;re a fit!</p>
<p>First of all, let me make it clear: <strong>I run a business,</strong> I am <em>not</em> a &ldquo;contractor,&rdquo; especially when that means &ldquo;employee in all but name&rdquo; (aka &ldquo;defacto employee,&rdquo; which is questionably legal, by the way). The relationship is a business-to-business one. I may be one person, but the arrangement is like that of an agency. I control my time, location, and equipment (though I am flexible on where code lives for compliance purposes and whatnot, and of course meetings are part of the relationship).</p>
<p>Still with me? Cool. Let&rsquo;s talk business.</p>
<p>Because I generally do large projects where scopes are subject to changing, I typically bill by the hour. The logistics are flexible, though, and I generally do one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase set number of hours &ndash; this is useful for knocking out a backlog or other shorter-term situation</li>
<li>A time-boxed contract without set hours &ndash; this is typically the best for large projects where either I supply the team or I&rsquo;m embedded in your team</li>
</ul>
<p>Both contracts are renewable/extendable (subject to availability), because expectations inevitably change over time, and pricing is determined by the services required and the nature of the relationship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also open to the &ldquo;purchase hours&rdquo; part on a retainer basis.</p>
<h2 id="still-works-for-you-lets-talk">Still Works For You? Let&rsquo;s Talk</h2>
<p>The best way to get in touch is via one of the communication options at the top of the page.</p>
<p>To save us both time, please be sure to include the important information about the work you need &ndash; things like tech stack, scope of work, and timeline requirements are super helpful in gauging whether we&rsquo;ll be a technical fit.</p>
<p>For conventional employement, please include pay range and benefit information.</p>
<p>In all cases, down-in-the-weeds details aren&rsquo;t required, just that 10,000-foot view will be sufficient to start.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you!</p>

      <description>Have you ever been using Google Sheets on your Android or iPhone, then suddenly find a sheet that you own stuck in read only mode? Or maybe you opened it to find a message that says &amp;ldquo;this document has changed significantly. Reload to sync,&amp;rdquo; and then it goes read only?&#xA;I have. It&amp;rsquo;s annoying as hell, and made yet more annoying by the fact that not a single help forum seems to acknowledge this is even an issue!</description>

      <title>That One Where I Talk For An Hour</title>

      <description>Holy shit, I actually just did a talk&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;in front of&amp;rdquo; a few hundred people&amp;hellip;for over an hour&amp;hellip; &amp;#x1f631;&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure you, dear reader, fully grasp the gravity of that.&#xA;See, fear of public speaking/stage fright (aka &amp;ldquo;glossophobia&amp;rdquo;) has been a thing that&amp;rsquo;s haunted me for&amp;hellip;basically my entire life. Incessant school bullying and an emotionally abusive head-of-household with a particular enjoyment of telling a 7 year old child everything they did wrong during the school performance, plus dealing with the fallout from a spouse&amp;rsquo;s undiagnosed mental illness will kind of do that to a person.</description>

      <description>So I happened to notice the other day that my site gets a lot more traffic than I realized (thanks, PointHQ!), so I tossed a little, lightweight analytics thing onto it so I can see where people are going and maybe we&amp;rsquo;re they&amp;rsquo;re coming from. (Hi, people! &amp;#x1f44b;)&#xA;One of the things I noticed was that an old, old blog post of mine was getting hit. Like&amp;hellip;so old that I didn&amp;rsquo;t migrate it originally, considering it defunct and no longer applicable.</description>

      <title>On Problem Solving</title>

      <description>The most important skill in tech isn&amp;rsquo;t the technology. It&amp;rsquo;s problem-solving. Whether you get into cyber security, system administration, or programming, the heart of all of it is really the ability to take a problem, break it apart, and work out a solution &amp;ndash; very often coming up with solutions that didn&amp;rsquo;t previously exist at all. Even on the more everyday scale, you&amp;rsquo;ll be constantly faced with error messages, odd software behavior, broken tests, and more that you&amp;rsquo;ll be expected to triage and if not fix yourself, hand off detailed information about the problem to those who can fix it.</description>

      <description>I was turned down for a job today.&#xA;This is nothing new. I&amp;rsquo;ve been turned down for jobs before. Hell, I&amp;rsquo;ve done the job hunt thing on a near-annual basis, which pretty much inevitably results in at least one application rejection per cycle. I&amp;rsquo;ve had so many that I&amp;rsquo;ve dealt with such rejections at nearly every step of the process.&#xA;There weren&amp;rsquo;t even a lot of stakes for this job. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking (and was even actively not looking) when it fell into my lap.</description>

      <description>The topic of changing verbiage within the tech industry, particularly as it relates to references to &amp;ldquo;master,&amp;rdquo; particularly in the &amp;ldquo;master/slave&amp;rdquo; contexts, but also in places like &amp;ldquo;master&amp;rdquo; branch in git (which does, in fact, have its roots in the &amp;ldquo;master/slave&amp;rdquo; paradigm), came up in a couple of Slack groups in which I participate.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s certainly not new (some discussions on the matter date back a decade or more), but it&amp;rsquo;s always kind of a contentious topic when it comes up, despite the terminology getting phased out over time.</description>

      <description>So I attended a protest the other day. It was the first time I&amp;rsquo;d been downtown since it started and I had walked there (and back) from one of the suburbs. A nearly 5 mile walk each way, with the inner-most mile or two containing a lot of plywood covering up a lot of damage.&#xA;But you know what stuck out to me? Two things:&#xA;Which places were hit. Of the places that were damaged and thus boarded up, which had murals and which had graffiti.</description>

      <description>Among my many blog post drafts, I have a satirical piece that was originally intended to turn all the &amp;ldquo;remote working is inferior [because it&amp;rsquo;s a new thing with a learning curve]&amp;rdquo; stuff on its head.&#xA;&amp;hellip;And then COVID-19 happened and pretty much overnight, just about everyone suddenly had to do at least some things remotely (even if work wasn&amp;rsquo;t one of them).&#xA;Schools are all now done in distance learning format (hat-tip to all of the school staff who busted their tails to make that pivot and get students of all ages going with relatively little disruption!</description>

      <description>Some Notes:&#xA;Contrary to most of my other posts, I plan to update this one periodically as things change and this is still current. Check back periodically for updates.&#xA;Are you a business owner or manager? Have a look at Remotewave.io&amp;rsquo;s guide, which approaches it from your side. :)&#xA;Well&amp;hellip;now that half the world is in quarantine of some level, a great many people are suddenly finding themselves tossed head first in the deep end of remote working.</description>

      <description>So&amp;hellip;Pelican (my previous static site generator) took a dump on me when I went to upload my latest blog post&amp;hellip; I attempted multiple paths to resurrect it, but they&amp;rsquo;ve all ultimately failed. &amp;#x1f622;&#xA;As a result, I&amp;rsquo;m moving my site to Hugo, but that requires some conversion (and probably clean-up). It&amp;rsquo;s been a bit tedious, but it does mean I&amp;rsquo;ve cleaned up my ancient posts that are no longer relevant, which is a plus.</description>

      <description>I actually had another installment of this series written back in February or so. I ended up scrapping it when life rendered it completely wrong almost as soon as I&amp;rsquo;d finished writing it. &amp;#x1f926;&#xA;Remember in part 3, where I mentioned that I got my windows replaced?&#xA;Apparently such investments have side-effects&amp;hellip;&#xA;Maybe I Should Start A Lemon Orchard &amp;hellip;Like frying the HVAC system, because it&amp;rsquo;s oversized for the house, when said house is properly insulated.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the start of &amp;ldquo;Autism Awareness Month,&amp;rdquo; which, for those of us with Autism, tends to be &amp;ldquo;the month to run and hide and wish I didn&amp;rsquo;t like blue, because we get inundated with neurotypical people who think they know our experience better than we do.&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t often write about the effect of Autism on my life (either my son&amp;rsquo;s or my own&amp;rsquo;s), because to be honest, 99% of the time, it&amp;rsquo;s boring and uneventful.</description>

      <title>Personal Core Values</title>

      <guid>http://shaunagordon.com/2018/03/08/personal-core-values/</guid>
      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve more actively sought out leadership positions, one of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about is the concept of core values. I see them actually communicated most often at the organization level, but I believe we have them at a personal level, too. We just don&amp;rsquo;t codify them. I like documenting things (because I like understanding), and since these are things I&amp;rsquo;d like to instill in the people I mentor and lead, I figured it&amp;rsquo;d be good to write them out and start documenting and exploring, and ultimately refining them.</description>

      <description>Last year, I wrote a post on automating the generation of my static-site blog. As they do, things have since changed, and I figured I&amp;rsquo;d update accordingly.&#xA;Changes To Travis And .travis.yml Travis recently made several updates, many of which make our job easier.&#xA;Build Settings Travis now has the option to build only if a .travis.yml file is present. Before, you needed a .travis.yml file in both your source and your display branch.</description>

      <description>I get the pleasure of writing integration after integration to Shopify at my day job. As a result, I have become quite familiar with their documentation and its gaps. The HMAC verification piece of the OAuth/embedded app installation process is a particularly glaring gap. So let&amp;rsquo;s close it.&#xA;What&amp;rsquo;s Wrong With The Docs? If you&amp;rsquo;re a Ruby developer, probably not much. Shopify&amp;rsquo;s got a nice little Ruby gem that does a great deal of the work for you.</description>

      <description>In part 2, I mentioned that I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;ldquo;productively lazy,&amp;rdquo; and prefer to automate what I can. Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to do that with my finances.&#xA;Hello, Automation! My husband finally got officially hired by his work, which converted him to salary. This gave us two benefits &amp;ndash; 1. his income is no longer locked to his hours, so the paychecks are the same, and 2. he and I are now on the same pay schedule (which makes for a really pretty number on payday).</description>

      <description>Back in part 1 I described the system that I used to work on getting my family out of debt and make ends meet. We&amp;rsquo;re now coming up on a year, so how did I do? Does this system actually work?&#xA;Putting The System To Work So, did it work? Well, as an acquaintance put it, there was &amp;ldquo;no budge in the budget,&amp;rdquo; but&amp;hellip;yeah, it has been working. In fact, it saved our hides when things fell apart a few months ago.</description>

      <description>I got an invite from Cal Evans to watch this week&amp;rsquo;s episode of his weekly show, with this week&amp;rsquo;s topic being a public speaking Q&amp;amp;A with Adam Culp (as this is the third time Cal has pinged me regarding public speaking, I think he really wants me to start &amp;#x1f62e;). It got me thinking again about my feelings toward the prospect of public speaking for me.&#xA;Espeically when it&amp;rsquo;s for larger audiences, my knee-jerk response to &amp;ldquo;you should give a talk,&amp;rdquo; has historically been &amp;ldquo;hell no.</description>

      <description>So, three months have passed since Shipt launched. So, how is it going?&#xA;Well&amp;hellip; these Facebook posts are rather indicative:&#xA;What Happened? Well, they recently made a change to their algorithm for order offers, which has greatly upset a great number of the shoppers and even for those that aren&amp;rsquo;t upset, it has altered how people schedule. Some people have removed themselves from the schedule out of protest, while others have done so out of necessity, so that their ranking isn&amp;rsquo;t affected by missing offers while working at another job.</description>

      <description>I could have sworn I wrote earlier about how one of the things I was planning on doing was personal finance and money-making outside of a typical 9-5. Oh well, if I haven&amp;rsquo;t said it before, I&amp;rsquo;ll say it now &amp;ndash; I find it annoying that there seems to be a gap between &amp;ldquo;flat broke with zero personal finance knowledge&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;personal finance guru,&amp;rdquo; and I&amp;rsquo;d like to bridge that gap, while I&amp;rsquo;m crossing it.</description>

      <description>Hey-o! This is a really old post and no longer reflects what I do. I ended up going back to software development in October of that year. It was a nice break, but unfortunately, 2016 was also the year gig economy jobs as a whole kind of took a dump. This is here for posterity, though, to avoid broken links. Be sure to read the update&#xA;Yes, this is basically what I do, minus the mess.</description>

      <description>Hey-o! There have been some changes made to this process. Be sure to check out the updates.&#xA;This is actually the second time I&amp;rsquo;ve leveraged Travis CI for managing my static-site blog, but apparently I didn&amp;rsquo;t write about it. I had done it shortly after setting up the Octopress version of my blog. It was nice and convenient, and dramatically lowered the barrier to writing more blog entries, though I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that until I lost that capability when I switched to Pelican (probably because the Octopress version was a bit finicky, due to breaking changes in the upstream Octopress repo, so the barrier was still pretty high).</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s This Strengths Finding Thing? I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of podcasts lately. I&amp;rsquo;m particularly a fan of Smart Passive Income and Screw The Nine To Five. They&amp;rsquo;re both great podcasts for learning about how to build your own business in order to generate income that&amp;rsquo;s not dependent on trading your time for money. They&amp;rsquo;re a gold mine of various resources, not just for starting and running one&amp;rsquo;s own business, but for business and life stuff in general.</description>

I all but literally told them &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not you, it&amp;rsquo;s me,&amp;rdquo; because that was the truth. I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything but good stuff to say about the company I worked for, because they were about as close to perfect as I&amp;rsquo;ve found.</description>

      <description>Since I posted my open letter to recruiters, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a number of people speaking out against it (&amp;ldquo;against&amp;rdquo; used loosely here, ranging from &amp;ldquo;employees need to be in the office&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the best companies hire the best people and the best people want to go into the office&amp;rdquo; (that&amp;rsquo;s not insulting at all) to &amp;ldquo;working remotely is isolating&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;in-person communication is better&amp;rdquo;). I decided to address a few of these things head-on.</description>

      <title>Ways To Keep Going</title>

      <description>When in the throes of a depressive episode (or on the edge of an anxiety attack or any other such motivation killer), it can be hard to maintain motivation and productivity. This can be detrimental when other people rely on you, or when you have a job to hold down.&#xA;Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve found a number of things that have helped keep me motivated through low times, and have decided to share them.</description>

      <title>An Open Letter To Recruiters</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2014/10/15/dear-recruiters/</link>

      <description>Dear Third Party Recruiters,&#xA;Due to the high volume of contact requests I’ve received, I have decided to write this open letter in order to improve the quality of my network.&#xA;The Greater Columbus Area is home to a very large number of third party recruiting companies. This means you have a lot of competition. Competition should mean improved quality. Unfortunately, what I generally see is rather disappointing.&#xA;We tech folks are generally a merit-based people.</description>

      <description>I’ve been torn over how open I should be with this, particularly in my professional life. My first instinct has been for it to be on a very need to know basis.&#xA;Then I met Greg Baugues.&#xA;Greg is a developer evangelist (devangelist) for Twilio, who speaks at conferences about his ADHD and Type II Bipolar, and he gets well-deserved standing ovations pretty much wherever he speaks. I still fight tearing up just thinking about the talk I attended at Laracon, back in mid-May, where he even took his Bipolar medication on stage.</description>

      <title>Review: Handcrafted CSS</title>

      <description>Handcrafted CSS: More Bulletproof Web Design, Video Edition&#xA;While at one of my previous clients, a coworker ordered this book as a resource at the office. I was the first to read it and simply couldn&#39;t put it down. Handcrafted CSS: More Bulletproof Web Design highlights modern CSS techniques that help build robust, attractive, designs.&#xA;Unlike most technical books, which often provide too much tech and not enough explanation, or too much theory and not enough tech, this book provides a fantastic balance, and even uses a running case study that it builds and enhances as the reader progresses through the book.</description>

      <description>Why Work Sucks and How to Fix It: No Schedules, No Meetings, No Joke--the Simple Change That Can Make Your Job Terrific&#xA;You anxiously look at your watch as the traffic creeps forward - 8:55am. There&#39;s no way you&#39;ll get to the office by 9, you still have 10 miles to go. When you finally do arrive at 9:15, you try to sneak to your desk unnoticed, but your boss is already there.</description>

      <description>About Me I make stuff.&#xA;My profession is problem solving. My chosen tool by which to do that has been developing software. I&amp;rsquo;ve written shell scripts, maintained systems in .Net, built APIs in PHP, and implemented interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I&amp;rsquo;ve maintained legacy systems and built cutting-edge, life-changing applications, as well as created little tools to support other people in getting their work done.&#xA;Writing software isn&amp;rsquo;t all I do, though.</description>

      <description>Buy Me Coffee (Ways I Make Money From This Site)&#xA;I Hate Ads&amp;hellip; I do, with a passion. The first extension I install on any browser is AdBlock. That&amp;rsquo;s how much I hate them. I also hate when blogs write a &amp;ldquo;review&amp;rdquo; or other article for the sole purpose of selling that product. You know the kind I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. They read like a commercial and are full of keywords and buzzwords about the product.</description>

      <description>Hiring Me Looking to work with me? Cool! Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the type of relationship.&#xA;What Type? Conventional Employment So you read through that &amp;#x261d;&amp;#xfe0f; and still want to hire me as a conventional employee? Well&amp;hellip;it didn&amp;rsquo;t scare you away, so that&amp;rsquo;s a start.&#xA;For my sake and yours, I have a high bar for conventional employment in particular. Let&amp;rsquo;s put it this way: I&amp;rsquo;ve turned down Amazon roughly half a dozen times at this point.</description>

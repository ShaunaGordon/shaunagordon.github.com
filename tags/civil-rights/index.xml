      <description>&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re a family here!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;How many times have you heard that from your boss? Or perhaps even the CEO of your company? I&amp;rsquo;ve heard it at nearly every company I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for. And I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for a lot.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s A Trap (I considered the Star Wars meme, but I like this one better.)&#xA;What do you call a familial relationship in which one person controls another&amp;rsquo;s financial security in order to gain compliance?</description>

      <title>What We Owe To Each Other</title>

      <description>The topic of changing verbiage within the tech industry, particularly as it relates to references to &amp;ldquo;master,&amp;rdquo; particularly in the &amp;ldquo;master/slave&amp;rdquo; contexts, but also in places like &amp;ldquo;master&amp;rdquo; branch in git (which does, in fact, have its roots in the &amp;ldquo;master/slave&amp;rdquo; paradigm), came up in a couple of Slack groups in which I participate.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s certainly not new (some discussions on the matter date back a decade or more), but it&amp;rsquo;s always kind of a contentious topic when it comes up, despite the terminology getting phased out over time.</description>

      <description>So I attended a protest the other day. It was the first time I&amp;rsquo;d been downtown since it started and I had walked there (and back) from one of the suburbs. A nearly 5 mile walk each way, with the inner-most mile or two containing a lot of plywood covering up a lot of damage.&#xA;But you know what stuck out to me? Two things:&#xA;Which places were hit. Of the places that were damaged and thus boarded up, which had murals and which had graffiti.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looks at dates on blog posts.&lt;/em&gt; Oh&amp;hellip;other than my Google Sheets thing, it&amp;rsquo;s been&amp;hellip;almost three years since I last posted&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oops. ðŸ˜…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What have I been doing in that time? Well&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;got-a-joband-got-laid-off-from-said-job&#34;&gt;Got A Job&amp;hellip;And Got Laid Off From Said Job&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In late 2021, I had a full time job opportunity fall into my lap. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a member of &lt;a href=&#34;https://gun.io&#34;&gt;Gun.io&lt;/a&gt; since like&amp;hellip;2019 or something like that, back when I first started doing serious freelancing. Sometime during 2021, they started offering more full-time positions, and the account manager there sent me a message about one at a little (&amp;ldquo;little&amp;rdquo;) company called Custom Ink.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I actually had another installment of this series written back in February or so. I ended up scrapping it when life rendered it completely wrong almost as soon as I&amp;rsquo;d finished writing it. &amp;#x1f926;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember in &lt;a href=&#34;http://shaunagordon.com/2017/08/23/personal-finance-part-3/&#34;&gt;part 3&lt;/a&gt;, where I mentioned that I got my windows replaced?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apparently such investments have side-effects&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;maybe-i-should-start-a-lemon-orchard&#34;&gt;Maybe I Should Start A Lemon Orchard&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;Like frying the HVAC system, because it&amp;rsquo;s oversized for the house, when said house is properly insulated. Nothing like spending a hot, rainy summer in a house with crap natural airflow, without air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Personal Finance, Part 3</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;http://shaunagordon.com/2016/12/16/personal-finance-part-2/&#34;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned that I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;ldquo;productively lazy,&amp;rdquo; and prefer to automate what I can. Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to do that with my finances.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;hello-automation&#34;&gt;Hello, Automation!&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My husband finally got officially hired by his work, which converted him to salary. This gave us two benefits &amp;ndash; 1. his income is no longer locked to his hours, so the paychecks are the same, and 2. he and I are now on the same pay schedule (which makes for a really pretty number on payday).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in &lt;a href=&#34;http://shaunagordon.com/2016/04/04/getting-started-with-personal-finance/&#34;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; I described the system that I used to work on getting my family out of debt and make ends meet. We&amp;rsquo;re now coming up on a year, so how did I do? Does this system actually work?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;putting-the-system-to-work&#34;&gt;Putting The System To Work&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, did it work? Well, as an acquaintance put it, there was &amp;ldquo;no budge in the budget,&amp;rdquo; but&amp;hellip;yeah, it has been working. In fact, it saved our hides when things fell apart a few months ago. I did tweak a few things, though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Getting Started With Personal Finance</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2016/04/04/getting-started-with-personal-finance/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I could have sworn I wrote earlier about how one of the things I was planning on doing was personal finance and money-making outside of a typical 9-5. Oh well, if I haven&amp;rsquo;t said it before, I&amp;rsquo;ll say it now &amp;ndash; I find it annoying that there seems to be a gap between &amp;ldquo;flat broke with zero personal finance knowledge&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;personal finance guru,&amp;rdquo; and I&amp;rsquo;d like to bridge that gap, while I&amp;rsquo;m crossing it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The topic of changing verbiage within the tech industry, particularly as it relates to references to &amp;ldquo;master,&amp;rdquo; particularly in the &amp;ldquo;master/slave&amp;rdquo; contexts, but also in places like &amp;ldquo;master&amp;rdquo; branch in git (which does, in fact, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2019-May/msg00066.html&#34;&gt;have its roots in the &amp;ldquo;master/slave&amp;rdquo; paradigm&lt;/a&gt;), came up in a couple of Slack groups in which I participate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s certainly not new (some discussions on the matter date back a decade or more), but it&amp;rsquo;s always kind of a contentious topic when it comes up, despite the terminology getting phased out over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I attended a protest the other day. It was the first time I&amp;rsquo;d been downtown since it started and I had walked there (and back) from one of the suburbs. A nearly 5 mile walk each way, with the inner-most mile or two containing a lot of plywood covering up a lot of damage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But you know what stuck out to me? Two things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Which places were hit.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Of the places that were damaged and thus boarded up, which had murals and which had graffiti.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These two things speak volumes about the situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;whats-this-strengths-finding-thing&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s This Strengths Finding Thing?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of podcasts lately. I&amp;rsquo;m particularly a fan of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/&#34;&gt;Smart Passive Income&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://screwtheninetofive.com/&#34;&gt;Screw The Nine To Five&lt;/a&gt;. They&amp;rsquo;re both great podcasts for learning about how to build your own business in order to generate income that&amp;rsquo;s not dependent on trading your time for money. They&amp;rsquo;re a gold mine of various resources, not just for starting and running one&amp;rsquo;s own business, but for business and life stuff in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

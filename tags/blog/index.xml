      <description>So&amp;hellip;Pelican (my previous static site generator) took a dump on me when I went to upload my latest blog post&amp;hellip; I attempted multiple paths to resurrect it, but they&amp;rsquo;ve all ultimately failed. &amp;#x1f622;&#xA;As a result, I&amp;rsquo;m moving my site to Hugo, but that requires some conversion (and probably clean-up). It&amp;rsquo;s been a bit tedious, but it does mean I&amp;rsquo;ve cleaned up my ancient posts that are no longer relevant, which is a plus.</description>

      <description>Last year, I wrote a post on automating the generation of my static-site blog. As they do, things have since changed, and I figured I&amp;rsquo;d update accordingly.&#xA;Changes To Travis And .travis.yml Travis recently made several updates, many of which make our job easier.&#xA;Build Settings Travis now has the option to build only if a .travis.yml file is present. Before, you needed a .travis.yml file in both your source and your display branch.</description>

      <description>Hey-o! There have been some changes made to this process. Be sure to check out the updates.&#xA;This is actually the second time I&amp;rsquo;ve leveraged Travis CI for managing my static-site blog, but apparently I didn&amp;rsquo;t write about it. I had done it shortly after setting up the Octopress version of my blog. It was nice and convenient, and dramatically lowered the barrier to writing more blog entries, though I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that until I lost that capability when I switched to Pelican (probably because the Octopress version was a bit finicky, due to breaking changes in the upstream Octopress repo, so the barrier was still pretty high).</description>

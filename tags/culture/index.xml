      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re a family here!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How many times have you heard that from your boss? Or perhaps even the CEO of your company? I&amp;rsquo;ve heard it at nearly every company I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for. And I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;its-a-trap&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s A Trap&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://shaunagordon.com/images/bait-thats-bait.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Tom Hardy in Mad Max shaking his head no, &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s bait&amp;rdquo;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I considered the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; meme, but I like this one better.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do you call a familial relationship in which one person controls another&amp;rsquo;s financial security in order to gain compliance?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What We Owe To Each Other</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2020/07/02/what-we-owe-to-each-other/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The topic of changing verbiage within the tech industry, particularly as it relates to references to &amp;ldquo;master,&amp;rdquo; particularly in the &amp;ldquo;master/slave&amp;rdquo; contexts, but also in places like &amp;ldquo;master&amp;rdquo; branch in git (which does, in fact, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2019-May/msg00066.html&#34;&gt;have its roots in the &amp;ldquo;master/slave&amp;rdquo; paradigm&lt;/a&gt;), came up in a couple of Slack groups in which I participate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s certainly not new (some discussions on the matter date back a decade or more), but it&amp;rsquo;s always kind of a contentious topic when it comes up, despite the terminology getting phased out over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Personal Core Values</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2018/03/08/personal-core-values/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve more actively sought out leadership positions, one of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about is the concept of core values. I see them actually communicated most often at the organization level, but I believe we have them at a personal level, too. We just don&amp;rsquo;t codify them. I like documenting things (because I like understanding), and since these are things I&amp;rsquo;d like to instill in the people I mentor and lead, I figured it&amp;rsquo;d be good to write them out and start documenting and exploring, and ultimately refining them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Finding One&#39;s Strengths</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;whats-this-strengths-finding-thing&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s This Strengths Finding Thing?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of podcasts lately. I&amp;rsquo;m particularly a fan of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/&#34;&gt;Smart Passive Income&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://screwtheninetofive.com/&#34;&gt;Screw The Nine To Five&lt;/a&gt;. They&amp;rsquo;re both great podcasts for learning about how to build your own business in order to generate income that&amp;rsquo;s not dependent on trading your time for money. They&amp;rsquo;re a gold mine of various resources, not just for starting and running one&amp;rsquo;s own business, but for business and life stuff in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When Culture Trumps Everything</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2015/06/15/when-culture-trumps-everything/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had an interesting experience recently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had a job opportunity dropped in my lap. A greenfield project that had a pay range $10-40k more than what I&amp;rsquo;m currently making.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You have my attention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I responded to the recruiter and within a few days, I had an initial meeting/interview with one of the higher-ups at the company.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I went and had a nice conversation with him. He was a cool person, not much older than myself. The company itself was pretty cool, and looked and acted very much like a Silicon Valley startup. We even sat in a conference room that had a feminism-themed mural on one wall (I was told that each of the conference rooms had mural of different themes, though the other rooms were occupied at the time, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to see much of them). The primary working space sported a handful of colorful market umbrellas (which I later found out served the purpose of shielding some of the employees from the direct sunlight that streamed in from the skylights overhead) interspersed through the three columns of desks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, I got an invitation to an Amazon recruiting event:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hi Shauna-&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I came across your information in our system and your background is impressive! We are currently looking to hire Sr. Software Development Engineers (SDEs) to join the Amazon Retail team and are hosting an “Invitation Only” recruiting event for the Amazon Media and International Expansion (ISE) organizations specifically the week of February 16th.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in being considered for this opportunity, please reply with your updated resume to [Recruiter&amp;rsquo;s email] if you’d like to be considered.

      <title>An Open Letter To Recruiters</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2014/10/15/dear-recruiters/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Third Party Recruiters,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Due to the high volume of contact requests I’ve received, I have decided to write this open letter in order to improve the quality of my network.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Greater Columbus Area is home to a very large number of third party recruiting companies. This means &lt;strong&gt;you have a lot of competition&lt;/strong&gt;. Competition should mean improved quality. Unfortunately, what I generally see is rather disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We tech folks are generally a merit-based people. We’ll respect you if we have reason to do so. You can earn that respect by demonstrating that you respect us and what we do (and no, saying that you do doesn’t cut it; show, don’t tell). Here are some ways to do that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

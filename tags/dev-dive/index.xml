      <description>Starting a new gig is very often described as &amp;ldquo;drinking from the fire hose,&amp;rdquo; and for good reason &amp;ndash; the primary job for a new person for the first few months is simply taking in everything about the job, the work, the people, etc.&#xA;I have proceeded to jack that up to eleven.&#xA;Why get just a new job, when I can get a new job, in an industry I&amp;rsquo;ve never worked in, working in a language I&amp;rsquo;ve never touched?</description>

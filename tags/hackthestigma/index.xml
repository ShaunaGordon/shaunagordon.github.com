      <description>I was turned down for a job today.&#xA;This is nothing new. I&amp;rsquo;ve been turned down for jobs before. Hell, I&amp;rsquo;ve done the job hunt thing on a near-annual basis, which pretty much inevitably results in at least one application rejection per cycle. I&amp;rsquo;ve had so many that I&amp;rsquo;ve dealt with such rejections at nearly every step of the process.&#xA;There weren&amp;rsquo;t even a lot of stakes for this job. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking (and was even actively not looking) when it fell into my lap.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the start of &amp;ldquo;Autism Awareness Month,&amp;rdquo; which, for those of us with Autism, tends to be &amp;ldquo;the month to run and hide and wish I didn&amp;rsquo;t like blue, because we get inundated with neurotypical people who think they know our experience better than we do.&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t often write about the effect of Autism on my life (either my son&amp;rsquo;s or my own&amp;rsquo;s), because to be honest, 99% of the time, it&amp;rsquo;s boring and uneventful.</description>

      <title>Ways To Keep Going</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2014/10/30/motivation/</link>

      <description>When in the throes of a depressive episode (or on the edge of an anxiety attack or any other such motivation killer), it can be hard to maintain motivation and productivity. This can be detrimental when other people rely on you, or when you have a job to hold down.&#xA;Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve found a number of things that have helped keep me motivated through low times, and have decided to share them.</description>

      <description>Iâ€™ve been torn over how open I should be with this, particularly in my professional life. My first instinct has been for it to be on a very need to know basis.&#xA;Then I met Greg Baugues.&#xA;Greg is a developer evangelist (devangelist) for Twilio, who speaks at conferences about his ADHD and Type II Bipolar, and he gets well-deserved standing ovations pretty much wherever he speaks. I still fight tearing up just thinking about the talk I attended at Laracon, back in mid-May, where he even took his Bipolar medication on stage.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looks at dates on blog posts.&lt;/em&gt; Oh&amp;hellip;other than my Google Sheets thing, it&amp;rsquo;s been&amp;hellip;almost three years since I last posted&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oops. ðŸ˜…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What have I been doing in that time? Well&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;got-a-joband-got-laid-off-from-said-job&#34;&gt;Got A Job&amp;hellip;And Got Laid Off From Said Job&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In late 2021, I had a full time job opportunity fall into my lap. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a member of &lt;a href=&#34;https://gun.io&#34;&gt;Gun.io&lt;/a&gt; since like&amp;hellip;2019 or something like that, back when I first started doing serious freelancing. Sometime during 2021, they started offering more full-time positions, and the account manager there sent me a message about one at a little (&amp;ldquo;little&amp;rdquo;) company called Custom Ink.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>That One Where I Talk For An Hour</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Holy shit, I &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; just did a talk&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;in front of&amp;rdquo; a few hundred people&amp;hellip;for over an hour&amp;hellip; &amp;#x1f631;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure you, dear reader, fully grasp the gravity of that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See, fear of public speaking/stage fright (aka &amp;ldquo;glossophobia&amp;rdquo;) has been a thing that&amp;rsquo;s haunted me for&amp;hellip;basically my entire life. Incessant school bullying and an emotionally abusive head-of-household with a particular enjoyment of telling a 7 year old child everything they did wrong during the school performance, plus dealing with the fallout from a spouse&amp;rsquo;s undiagnosed mental illness will kind of do that to a person.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Rejection and Mental Health</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2020/09/04/on-rejection-and-mental-health/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was turned down for a job today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is nothing new. I&amp;rsquo;ve been turned down for jobs before. Hell, I&amp;rsquo;ve done the job hunt thing on a near-annual basis, which pretty much inevitably results in at least one application rejection per cycle. I&amp;rsquo;ve had so many that I&amp;rsquo;ve dealt with such rejections at nearly every step of the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There weren&amp;rsquo;t even a lot of stakes for this job. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking (and was even actively &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; looking) when it fell into my lap. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; the job (which changed the entire feel of the interviews even more than I anticipated).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Autism Awareness And The Blue Ranger</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the start of &amp;ldquo;Autism Awareness Month,&amp;rdquo; which, for those of us &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; Autism, tends to be &amp;ldquo;the month to run and hide and wish I didn&amp;rsquo;t like blue, because we get inundated with neurotypical people who think they know our experience better than we do.&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t often write about the effect of Autism on my life (either my son&amp;rsquo;s or my own&amp;rsquo;s), because to be honest, 99% of the time, it&amp;rsquo;s boring and uneventful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ways To Keep Going</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2014/10/30/motivation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When in the throes of a depressive episode (or on the edge of an anxiety attack or any other such motivation killer), it can be hard to maintain motivation and productivity. This can be detrimental when other people rely on you, or when you have a job to hold down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve found a number of things that have helped keep me motivated through low times, and have decided to share them. Unlike other articles giving advice on &amp;ldquo;cheering up,&amp;rdquo; the items here may or may not actually lift your mood. That&amp;rsquo;s not the point of them, and anyone who&amp;rsquo;s dealt with depression will tell you that most of the time, things designed to &amp;ldquo;cheer you up&amp;rdquo; don&amp;rsquo;t really work. If it does lift your mood, then that&amp;rsquo;s a positive side effect, but as Winston Churchill put it, &amp;ldquo;when you&amp;rsquo;re going through hell, keep going.&amp;rdquo; These items are intended to do &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; help you keep going.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>You&#39;re Not Alone</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2014/08/19/youre-not-alone/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve been torn over how open I should be with this, particularly in my professional life. My first instinct has been for it to be on a very need to know basis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I met &lt;a href=&#34;http://baugues.com/&#34;&gt;Greg Baugues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Greg is a developer evangelist (devangelist) for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twilio.com/&#34;&gt;Twilio&lt;/a&gt;, who speaks at conferences about his ADHD and Type II Bipolar, and he gets well-deserved standing ovations pretty much wherever he speaks. I still fight tearing up just thinking about &lt;a href=&#34;http://userscape.com/laracon/2014/gregbaugues.html&#34;&gt;the talk I attended at Laracon&lt;/a&gt;, back in mid-May, where he even took his Bipolar medication on stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

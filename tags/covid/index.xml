      <description>Among my many blog post drafts, I have a satirical piece that was originally intended to turn all the &amp;ldquo;remote working is inferior [because it&amp;rsquo;s a new thing with a learning curve]&amp;rdquo; stuff on its head.
&amp;hellip;And then COVID-19 happened and pretty much overnight, just about everyone suddenly had to do at least some things remotely (even if work wasn&amp;rsquo;t one of them).

      <description>Some Notes:
Contrary to most of my other posts, I plan to update this one periodically as things change and this is still current. Check back periodically for updates.
Are you a business owner or manager? Have a look at Remotewave.io&amp;rsquo;s guide, which approaches it from your side. :)
 Well&amp;hellip;now that half the world is in quarantine of some level, a great many people are suddenly finding themselves tossed head first in the deep end of remote working.</description>

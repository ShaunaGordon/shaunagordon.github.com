      <title>A Look Back At Shipt</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I happened to notice the other day that my site gets a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more traffic than I realized (thanks, PointHQ!), so I tossed a little, lightweight analytics thing onto it so I can see where people are going and maybe we&amp;rsquo;re they&amp;rsquo;re coming from. (Hi, people! &amp;#x1f44b;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the things I noticed was that &lt;a href=&#34;http://shaunagordon.com/2016/01/13/a-week-of-shipt&#34;&gt;an old, &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; blog post&lt;/a&gt; of mine was getting hit. Like&amp;hellip;so old that I didn&amp;rsquo;t migrate it originally, considering it defunct and no longer applicable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Being A Shiptster, Three Months In</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, three months have passed since &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.shipt.com/&#34;&gt;Shipt&lt;/a&gt; launched. So, how is it going?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well&amp;hellip; these Facebook posts are rather indicative:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FShipttoday%2Fposts%2F541092312740359&amp;width=500&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;180&#34; style=&#34;border:none;overflow:hidden&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowTransparency=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FShipttoday%2Fposts%2F540685849447672&amp;width=500&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;161&#34; style=&#34;border:none;overflow:hidden&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowTransparency=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-happened&#34;&gt;What Happened?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, they recently made a change to their algorithm for order offers, which has greatly upset a great number of the shoppers and even for those that aren&amp;rsquo;t upset, it has altered how people schedule. Some people have removed themselves from the schedule out of protest, while others have done so out of necessity, so that their ranking isn&amp;rsquo;t affected by missing offers while working at another job.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Week Of Shipt</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2016/01/13/a-week-of-shipt/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hey-o! This is a really old post and no longer reflects what I do. I ended up going back to software development in October of that year. It was a nice break, but unfortunately, 2016 was also the year gig economy jobs as a whole kind of took a dump. This is here for posterity, though, to avoid broken links. Be sure to &lt;a href=&#34;http://shaunagordon.com/2021/02/10/a-look-back-at-shipt&#34;&gt;read the update&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/JzuCGI5.gif&#34; alt=&#34;The grocery deliverator from Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs 2. A young man throws produce into a portal and the produce comes out another portal onto his father&amp;rsquo;s head.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From Developer to Shipt Shopper</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2016/01/06/from-developer-to-shipt-shopper/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wait&amp;hellip;what? I traded a lucrative programming career for&amp;hellip;buying and delivering groceries?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, yes. For now, at least.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;simply-put----i-got-burned-the-f---out&#34;&gt;Simply Put &amp;ndash; I Got Burned The F&amp;ndash; Out&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I left my development job just before Thanksgiving. I all but literally told them &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not you, it&amp;rsquo;s me,&amp;rdquo; because that was the truth. I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything but good stuff to say about the company I worked for, because they were about as close to perfect as I&amp;rsquo;ve found. They really didn&amp;rsquo;t care about the number of hours you worked, as long as you got the work done. They care about their employees (I went to the upper management a couple of times with some issues, and not only did they &lt;em&gt;listen&lt;/em&gt; to what I had to say, they took it seriously and made change in order to fix the underlying problem). They valued employees&amp;rsquo; time and acted accordingly (kept meetings and interruptions to a minimum, had an unlimited paid time off policy, etc). The code, itself, is what burnt me out, really, and even that, had I been able to stick it out, probably would have resolved over time, as we modernized the legacy system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

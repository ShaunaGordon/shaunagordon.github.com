      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got an invite from Cal Evans to watch this week&amp;rsquo;s episode of his weekly show, with this week&amp;rsquo;s topic being a public speaking Q&amp;amp;A with Adam Culp (as this is the &lt;em&gt;third&lt;/em&gt; time Cal has pinged me regarding public speaking, I think he &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wants me to start &amp;#x1f62e;). It got me thinking again about my feelings toward the prospect of public speaking for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Espeically when it&amp;rsquo;s for larger audiences, my knee-jerk response to &amp;ldquo;you should give a talk,&amp;rdquo; has historically been &amp;ldquo;hell no.&amp;rdquo; For the longest time, I chalked it up to glossophobia (aka - stage fright/fear of public speaking). Recently, though, things in my life have changed such that the idea is no longer so panic-inducing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

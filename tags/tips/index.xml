      <title>On Problem Solving</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most important skill in tech isn&amp;rsquo;t the technology. It&amp;rsquo;s problem-solving. Whether you get into cyber security, system administration, or programming, the heart of all of it is really the ability to take a problem, break it apart, and work out a solution &amp;ndash; very often coming up with solutions that didn&amp;rsquo;t previously exist at all. Even on the more everyday scale, you&amp;rsquo;ll be constantly faced with error messages, odd software behavior, broken tests, and more that you&amp;rsquo;ll be expected to triage and if not fix yourself, hand off detailed information about the problem to those who can fix it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pelican, Travis, and Github, Part 2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, I wrote a post on &lt;a href=&#34;http://shaunagordon.com/2016/01/13/pelican-travis-and-github/&#34;&gt;automating the generation of my static-site blog&lt;/a&gt;. As they do, things have since changed, and I figured I&amp;rsquo;d update accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;changes-to-travis-and-travisyml&#34;&gt;Changes To Travis And .travis.yml&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Travis recently made several updates, many of which make our job easier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;build-settings&#34;&gt;Build Settings&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Travis now has the option to build only if a .travis.yml file is present. Before, you needed a .travis.yml file in both your source and your display branch. Now, that&amp;rsquo;s no longer the case.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Personal Finance, Part 3</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;http://shaunagordon.com/2016/12/16/personal-finance-part-2/&#34;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned that I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;ldquo;productively lazy,&amp;rdquo; and prefer to automate what I can. Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to do that with my finances.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;hello-automation&#34;&gt;Hello, Automation!&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My husband finally got officially hired by his work, which converted him to salary. This gave us two benefits &amp;ndash; 1. his income is no longer locked to his hours, so the paychecks are the same, and 2. he and I are now on the same pay schedule (which makes for a really pretty number on payday).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in &lt;a href=&#34;http://shaunagordon.com/2016/04/04/getting-started-with-personal-finance/&#34;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; I described the system that I used to work on getting my family out of debt and make ends meet. We&amp;rsquo;re now coming up on a year, so how did I do? Does this system actually work?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;putting-the-system-to-work&#34;&gt;Putting The System To Work&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, did it work? Well, as an acquaintance put it, there was &amp;ldquo;no budge in the budget,&amp;rdquo; but&amp;hellip;yeah, it has been working. In fact, it saved our hides when things fell apart a few months ago. I did tweak a few things, though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Getting Started With Personal Finance</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2016/04/04/getting-started-with-personal-finance/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I could have sworn I wrote earlier about how one of the things I was planning on doing was personal finance and money-making outside of a typical 9-5. Oh well, if I haven&amp;rsquo;t said it before, I&amp;rsquo;ll say it now &amp;ndash; I find it annoying that there seems to be a gap between &amp;ldquo;flat broke with zero personal finance knowledge&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;personal finance guru,&amp;rdquo; and I&amp;rsquo;d like to bridge that gap, while I&amp;rsquo;m crossing it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hey-o! There have been some changes made to this process. &lt;a href=&#34;http://shaunagordon.com/2017/09/01/pelican-travis-and-github&#34;&gt;Be sure to check out the updates.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is actually the second time I&amp;rsquo;ve leveraged &lt;a href=&#34;https://travis-ci.org/&#34;&gt;Travis CI&lt;/a&gt; for managing my static-site blog, but apparently I didn&amp;rsquo;t write about it. I had done it shortly after setting up the Octopress version of my blog. It was nice and convenient, and dramatically lowered the barrier to writing more blog entries, though I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that until I lost that capability when I switched to Pelican (probably because the Octopress version was a bit finicky, due to breaking changes in the upstream Octopress repo, so the barrier was still pretty high).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An Open Letter To Recruiters</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2014/10/15/dear-recruiters/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Third Party Recruiters,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Due to the high volume of contact requests I’ve received, I have decided to write this open letter in order to improve the quality of my network.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Greater Columbus Area is home to a very large number of third party recruiting companies. This means &lt;strong&gt;you have a lot of competition&lt;/strong&gt;. Competition should mean improved quality. Unfortunately, what I generally see is rather disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We tech folks are generally a merit-based people. We’ll respect you if we have reason to do so. You can earn that respect by demonstrating that you respect us and what we do (and no, saying that you do doesn’t cut it; show, don’t tell). Here are some ways to do that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looks at dates on blog posts.&lt;/em&gt; Oh&amp;hellip;other than my Google Sheets thing, it&amp;rsquo;s been&amp;hellip;almost three years since I last posted&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oops. ðŸ˜…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What have I been doing in that time? Well&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;got-a-joband-got-laid-off-from-said-job&#34;&gt;Got A Job&amp;hellip;And Got Laid Off From Said Job&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In late 2021, I had a full time job opportunity fall into my lap. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a member of &lt;a href=&#34;https://gun.io&#34;&gt;Gun.io&lt;/a&gt; since like&amp;hellip;2019 or something like that, back when I first started doing serious freelancing. Sometime during 2021, they started offering more full-time positions, and the account manager there sent me a message about one at a little (&amp;ldquo;little&amp;rdquo;) company called Custom Ink.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Problem Solving</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2020/10/21/on-problem-solving/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most important skill in tech isn&amp;rsquo;t the technology. It&amp;rsquo;s problem-solving. Whether you get into cyber security, system administration, or programming, the heart of all of it is really the ability to take a problem, break it apart, and work out a solution &amp;ndash; very often coming up with solutions that didn&amp;rsquo;t previously exist at all. Even on the more everyday scale, you&amp;rsquo;ll be constantly faced with error messages, odd software behavior, broken tests, and more that you&amp;rsquo;ll be expected to triage and if not fix yourself, hand off detailed information about the problem to those who can fix it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Personal Core Values</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2018/03/08/personal-core-values/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve more actively sought out leadership positions, one of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about is the concept of core values. I see them actually communicated most often at the organization level, but I believe we have them at a personal level, too. We just don&amp;rsquo;t codify them. I like documenting things (because I like understanding), and since these are things I&amp;rsquo;d like to instill in the people I mentor and lead, I figured it&amp;rsquo;d be good to write them out and start documenting and exploring, and ultimately refining them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Finding One&#39;s Strengths</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;whats-this-strengths-finding-thing&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s This Strengths Finding Thing?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of podcasts lately. I&amp;rsquo;m particularly a fan of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/&#34;&gt;Smart Passive Income&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://screwtheninetofive.com/&#34;&gt;Screw The Nine To Five&lt;/a&gt;. They&amp;rsquo;re both great podcasts for learning about how to build your own business in order to generate income that&amp;rsquo;s not dependent on trading your time for money. They&amp;rsquo;re a gold mine of various resources, not just for starting and running one&amp;rsquo;s own business, but for business and life stuff in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

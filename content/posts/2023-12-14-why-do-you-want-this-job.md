It is too general, though. It's extremely vague, comes off as generic, and as mentioned, the real answer to "why do you want this job?" is first and foremost "because I need food on the table and a roof over my head." That answer isn't mercenary, it's the honest truth, especially in times like this, where company after company is laying off 10, 15, 20 percent of their employees.



If you want to know what has piqued their interest in your company or industry, then ask them *that*. "What got you interested in supply chain management?" is a much better - and still open-ended - question.

<p>We've all been there -- the peon, low-level, replaceable employee at the bottom of the corporate food chain. Unfortunately, since we can't all be wildly successful business owners, or get promoted to management almost immediately, we sometimes have to do what we can in our little peon positions. It's heartening, then, to find <a href="http://jamesshore.com/Change-Diary/">James Shore's Change Diary</a>, via <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/09/changing-your-organization-for-peons.html">Jeff Atwood's blog</a>, from when James was working as a developer shortly after the DotCom bust. </p><p>It's a long read, and I haven't quite gotten all the way through it, but even what I've read so far has made it well worth the read. There's success, there's failure, but most of all, there's proof that even one peon can make a difference in a company. It's a lesson that employees and managers alike would do well to learn, I think. </p></div>

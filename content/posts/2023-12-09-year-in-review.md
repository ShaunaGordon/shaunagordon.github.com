_Looks at dates on blog posts._ Oh...other than my Google Sheets thing, it's been...almost three years since I last posted...

Oops. ðŸ˜…

What have I been doing in that time? Well...

## Got A Job...Got Laid Off

In late 2021, I had a full time job opportunity fall into my lap. I've been a member of [Gun.io](https://gun.io) since like...2019 or something like that, back when I first started doing serious freelancing. Sometime during 2021, they started offering more full-time positions, and the account manager there sent me a message about one at a little company called Custom Ink.

Uh...yes please.

I remembered them from Laracon circa 2014, when they were the company that printed the shirts. To this day, I still have that shirt. Granted, the shirt itself has fallen apart, but the design is still as pristine as ever. I also remember the organizers raving about the hands-on help from the designers at Custom Ink. Even just meeting the people behind that was something I didn't want to pass up.

So, I interviewed. And the director of engineering was champing at the bit to get me through the hiring process, so I could start as soon as possible. Thanksgiving was in there, though, so my first day wasn't until December 21st. (Side note: I don't recommend starting a new job in the last couple of weeks of December like that. It's hell to get onboarded, because half the company is out. Also, it makes taxes annoying.)

But, I made it through the first holidays, got up and running with a shiny new M1 Macbook and started firehosing all the tech. The first year was basically that, because there was just...so...much. That was fine, though. I got to visit the nearby in-house production facility, meet my coworkers and my users, and build a solid foundation within my team, and in year two, I really started taking off. I went from just doing stuff in my team, to working on a number of side initiatives with people from a bunch of teams -- and not just engineers. One of my first outside-the-team "work buddies" was actually the engineering manager of one of the other teams, with whom I worked closely to help get better documentation going, and more recently, I was the only non-manager on a [kaizen team](https://blog.kainexus.com/insights/improvement-disciplines/kaizen/what-is-kaizen/everything-your-team-needs-to-know), until I pulled on a junior engineer who was looking into parallel work (yeah...I did a double-take on that one, when I first got the calendar invite and did ask the organizer if that was right ðŸ˜… ). When my manager needed to do the quarterly review, I got to challenge his initial assessment with a page-long list of accomplishments. Suffice it to say, that assessment got bumped up.

Fast forward to now, and...I'm again without a job. Unfortunately, I was among the hefty chunk of people that got laid off as part of a strategic move.

I swear, I'm cosmically disallowed from having a job for more than 2 years.

It's not that I don't _want_ to work for the same company for more than that. It's just that something always seems to come up by that time. Maybe one day, I'll have a job long enough to actually use two hands when measuring my tenure in years.

![But it is not this day](https://media1.tenor.com/images/6b4fa08a8d8fd37e2d0c6fd875d39353/tenor.gif?itemid=14797074)

Ah well...such is life. On to the next thing, I guess.

## Dealt With A Delinquent Former Client

That was an adventure...

As I wound down my freelance stuff, since working full time took all of my energy, my last client started getting super flaky. Some half a dozen unpaid invoices later, and I had the... *ahem* ... "pleasure" of attempting to serve him for nonpayment.

That's stupidly harder than it should be.

I ended up out some $1500, because we couldn't actually track him down at the known addresses we had, and the notification about that always came _after_ the court dates. ðŸ˜¡

Lesson learned on that front. I'll deal with the overhead of being on a platform like Gun.io or the one I had started with that client on if it means I'm not the one that has to chase down payments. The other frustrating part, too, was that they had been good about paying for _years_ at that point, until one day they just...weren't.

## Got Student Loan Forgiveness Stuff

The DeVry settlement finally went through! ðŸ¥³

And because I was dirt poor when I got those loans, I got a decent chunk from the Biden thing, too. It wasn't the full advertised amount, because of what I make now, but that's okay.

Between that and the "we're sorry for the former administration's asshattery about this" interest forgiveness, my student loans are now about half of what they had once been. I can work with that (which is good, because that also means the forbearance is over, unless I apply for the regular kind...but I don't want to if I can help it).

## Paid Off A Few Bills...And Added A Couple More

On the personal finance front, I got a couple of bills paid off! ðŸ¥³ ...Though I did add a couple others. Still a net gain, though.

Previously, I mentioned getting a home equity line of credit. It was great for why we got it, and it served its purpose, but it was a variable rate loan.

...you can probably see where I'm going with this one...

It recently became my highest-interest loan, something I saw coming as soon as the rates started rising. And at a whopping 10%, it became financially better to dip into my savings account to pay it off. So I did exactly that last month (perfect timing, I know).

I paid off a few others, too, though I've forgotten what they are at this point.

They were replaced with a loan for solar panels and a new bed. The bed was needed, because we weren't sleeping properly anymore on the old one.

The solar panels were intended to be essentially cashflowed with the electric bill savings. That one...partially worked.

My house is actually quite ideal for solar panels, and the panels produce even a little more than what they're estimated for. Unfortunately...the company we got them from did not estimate for 100% of our usage. That's...its own story for another time. I don't regret getting them, though I do wish I'd gotten them from someone else.

## Bought A Car With Cash

This was just nice to do, I'll be honest. With the pandemic winding down and the family doing more things out of the house, we needed a second car, but I didn't want another loan. The car didn't need to be brand new, since we mostly needed it for the occasional time when we were both out of the house for one reason or another.

So, I figured out what our budget was, then we checked out the "under $15k" options at a few of the local dealerships. We eventually found one that worked for us, and had the joy of writing a check for the amount and driving off the lot owning it outright.

Behold! The power of money management!

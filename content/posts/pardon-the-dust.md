So...Pelican (my previous static site generator) took a dump on me when I went to upload my latest blog post... I attempted multiple paths to resurrect it, but they've all ultimately failed. :cry:

As a result, I'm moving my site to Hugo, but that requires some conversion (and probably clean-up). In the meantime, things are going to be a bit barebones around here, because it's already late as I'm writing this.

I know, I need to put a new theme on this thing. It's funny how you start seeing something everywhere once you find out about it for the first time.

I'm not totally sure when, but I fully plan on building a new theme. I'd like to play around with responsive design, so this should be interesting.

I'll also be looking into a sort of "tag cloud" for the sidebar, and a way to list the "tags" (or, as Octopress calls them, "categories"). I find it hard to believe that you can put categories into your posts and not be able to make use of them.

Oh, and your tip for the day - I never remember to use "rake" for doing Octopress tasks. I always want to run "octopress [task]", so I added to my ~/.bashrc the line:

```sh
alias octopress="rake"
```

To use it right away, just run `source ~/.bashrc`. :)

In [part 2](http://shaunagordon.com/blog/2016/12/16/personal-finance-part-2/), I mentioned that I'm "productively lazy," and prefer to automate what I can. Well, I've managed to do that.

# Hello, Automation!

My husband finally got officially hired by his work, which converted him to salary. This gave us two benefits -- 1. his income is no longer locked to his hours, so the paychecks are the same, and 2. he and I are now on the same pay schedule (which makes for a really pretty number on payday).

The synchronized paychecks is a bit of a mixed blessing. On the positive side, it makes my calculation for the monthly budget that much easier. It was a pain in the ass to calculate how much had to be allocated from which check, when one came every week and the other twice monthly. I got it, but it was cumbersome, and I had to account for my husband taking a day off (the most common time off use case for us). On the negative side...I lose the nice little smoothing effect a weekly paycheck allowed. Having a weekly paycheck allowed for grocery expenses to be pulled from it, for example. That's been the biggest adjustment for me.

It does greatly simplify my allocations, though. Instead of having to calculate how much comes from which check and setting up a bunch of transactions with different cadences, monthly allocations are simply divided by 2 and assigned to wherever they need to go with just a couple of monthly recurring transactions.

This also makes the vast majority of the bill paying a fair bit simpler. Since half of the money is available on the 1st and 16th of every month, I know which bills can get paid with each cycle. From there, it's a matter of setting up my account to pay the bills at the correct time.

This is where things get a bit tricky, because now we have to deal with the bills and the technical systems between them and my bank, as well as the fact that some of the bills are on mandatory autopay via the company the subscription is through.

## Push Me, Pull You

Personally, I'd prefer it if all of the commands to pay bills were originating from my bank. A "push" system, as opposed to a "pull" system, if you will. Unfortunately, reality doesn't allow for that. Some require autopay via the biller, while for others, if I want autopay, I have to do it through the bank, and still others don't really have a sane way to handle autopay at all.

The result is that some originate from the bank, while others originate from the billing company, and a couple need paid manually. Far from perfect, but a step in the right direction.

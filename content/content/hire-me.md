# Hiring Me

Looking to work with me? Cool! Let's start with the type of relationship.

## What Type?

### Conventional Employment

So you read through that :point_up: and still want to hire me as a conventional employee? Well...it didn't scare you away, so that's a start.

For my sake and yours, I have a high bar for conventional employment in particular. Let's put it this way: I've turned down Amazon roughly half a dozen times at this point.

So, you'll want to start by reading the posts in [the "culture" tag](/tags/culture/). Ideally, you'll want to read most of my blog, though the [business category](/categories/business/) might be most relevant to you (ostensibly a recruiter or businessperson of some sort).

I also expect to get paid what I'm worth. Don't bother sending me leads unless the base compensation is six figures.

Oh, and location-independent. I'm not interested in relocating (so please don't ask), and while I don't mind going into the office periodically (after this whole Covid thing gets worked out; and what "periodically" means will depend on where "the office" is), I do best working where I'm most productive.

I also have this snazzy office of my own, and I'd hate for it to go to waste. :wink:

### Independent Consulting

You've got some work that needs done, but don't need a full time employee for it? Awesome! Let's see if we're a fit!

First of all, let me make it clear: **I run a business,** I am _not_ a "contractor," especially when that means "employee in all but name" (aka "defacto employee," which is questionably legal, by the way). The relationship is a business-to-business one. I may be one person, but the arrangement is like that of an agency. I control my time, location, and equipment (though I am flexible on where code lives for compliance purposes and whatnot, and of course meetings are part of the relationship).

Still with me? Cool. Let's talk business.

Because I generally do large projects where scopes are subject to changing, I typically bill by the hour. The logistics are flexible, though, and I generally do one of two ways:

* Purchase set number of hours -- this is useful for knocking out a backlog or other shorter-term situation
* A time-boxed contract without set hours -- this is typically the best for large projects where either I supply the team or I'm embedded in your team

Both contracts are renewable/extendable (subject to availability), because expectations inevitably change over time, and pricing is determined by the services required and the nature of the relationship.

I'm also open to the "purchase hours" part on a retainer basis.

## Still Works For You? Let's Talk

The best way to get in touch is via one of the communication options at the top of the page.

To save us both time, please be sure to include the important information about the work you need -- things like tech stack, scope of work, and timeline requirements are super helpful in gauging whether we'll be a technical fit.

For conventional employement, please include pay range and benefit information.

In all cases, down-in-the-weeds details aren't required, just that 10,000-foot view will be sufficient to start.

I look forward to hearing from you!

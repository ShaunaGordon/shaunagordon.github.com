# About Me

I make stuff.

My profession is problem solving. My chosen tool by which to do that has been developing software. I've written shell scripts, maintained systems in .Net, built APIs in PHP, and implemented interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've maintained legacy systems and built cutting-edge, life-changing applications, as well as created little tools to support other people in getting their work done.

Writing software isn't all I do, though. I like to write English words, too, and my writing is about as eclectic as my coding. While my blog started (ages ago) as a "tech and work blog," it soon expanded out to other aspects of life, including personal finance and the broader culture. Maybe I'll spin some topics off to their own blogs, eventually.

Professionally, I've been a software developer for over a decade, with particular focus in full stack, PHP-based (and more recently, Python-based) web development. I've also picked up professional teaching over the past year or so. For more details about my experience, [visit my resume](http://resume.shaunagordon.com/).

Over the past couple of years, I've embraced what seems to be my fate as an independent consultant and I run my own software development shop, World Tree Limited, through which I provide various development services and plan to release my own software products.

Culture means a great deal to me, so it should come as no surprise that I hold it above all else when working with organizations and I have a fair number of words to say about the current broader culture here in the US, and they go hand-in-hand. I'm a staunch advocate of equitable culture, both inside and outside the (proverbial or literal) office, and I'm not afraid to lose "opportunities" (though I'd argue such things are not my kind of opportunities) because of it.

Maybe that makes me ["unemployable"](https://unemployable.com/podcast/intro/)?

Or perhaps it's a criticism of conventional workplaces and I've just been [ahead of the curve](https://www.gorowe.com/)?

Regardless, it gives my mind the never-ending puzzle of finding better ways of supporting my family.

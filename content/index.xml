      <description>About Me I make stuff.&#xA;My profession is problem solving. My chosen tool by which to do that has been developing software. I&amp;rsquo;ve written shell scripts, maintained systems in .Net, built APIs in PHP, and implemented interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I&amp;rsquo;ve maintained legacy systems and built cutting-edge, life-changing applications, as well as created little tools to support other people in getting their work done.&#xA;Writing software isn&amp;rsquo;t all I do, though.</description>

      <description>Buy Me Coffee (Ways I Make Money From This Site)&#xA;I Hate Ads&amp;hellip; I do, with a passion. The first extension I install on any browser is AdBlock. That&amp;rsquo;s how much I hate them. I also hate when blogs write a &amp;ldquo;review&amp;rdquo; or other article for the sole purpose of selling that product. You know the kind I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. They read like a commercial and are full of keywords and buzzwords about the product.</description>

      <description>Hiring Me Looking to work with me? Cool! Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the type of relationship.&#xA;What Type? Conventional Employment So you read through that &amp;#x261d;&amp;#xfe0f; and still want to hire me as a conventional employee? Well&amp;hellip;it didn&amp;rsquo;t scare you away, so that&amp;rsquo;s a start.&#xA;For my sake and yours, I have a high bar for conventional employment in particular. Let&amp;rsquo;s put it this way: I&amp;rsquo;ve turned down Amazon roughly half a dozen times at this point.</description>

					<p>I could have sworn I wrote earlier about how one of the things I was planning on doing was personal finance and money-making outside of a typical 9-5. Oh well, if I haven&rsquo;t said it before, I&rsquo;ll say it now &ndash; I find it annoying that there seems to be a gap between &ldquo;flat broke with zero personal finance knowledge&rdquo; and &ldquo;personal finance guru,&rdquo; and I&rsquo;d like to bridge that gap, while I&rsquo;m crossing it.</p>
<h1 id="where-did-i-start">Where Did I Start?&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#where-did-i-start"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h1>
<p>Okay, admittedly, I haven&rsquo;t been at the &ldquo;zero knowledge&rdquo; point for quite some time. My college degrees included courses in accounting, and I grew up dirt poor, so I&rsquo;m no stranger to finances in general. <em>However,</em> as I&rsquo;m reading books like <em>Rich Dad, Poor Dad</em> and other &ldquo;grow your non-job income&rdquo; type of books and articles, I&rsquo;ve found them to be really freaking vague on the details of getting &ldquo;from broke and homeless&rdquo; to buying that first investment property or other financial milestone. I suspect part of it is simply because, by the time they&rsquo;ve written about it, it&rsquo;s already years in the past, and they&rsquo;ve simply forgotten all the details of which a new person is forced to become completely aware. So, the first step, then, is to start writing about it <em>now,</em> while I&rsquo;m still activelly doing things, and while it&rsquo;s still fresh in my mind.</p>
<h2 id="rewind-back-to-the-beginning-of-q4-2015">Rewind, Back To The Beginning Of Q4, 2015&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#rewind-back-to-the-beginning-of-q4-2015"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>In the fall of 2015, my husband and I both found ourselves burnt out at our jobs. For him, he&rsquo;d finally had it working at what many in his industry call &ldquo;a meatgrinder,&rdquo; because of the disconnect between the main corporation and its values and the IT &ldquo;branch&rdquo; of things. For me, <a href="http://shaunagordon.com/2016/01/06/from-developer-to-shipt-shopper/">as I&rsquo;ve written about already</a>, I just got burnt out in general. The end result was that neither of us could continue working in our respective positions.</p>
<p>Part of the agreement for me opting out of the conventional workforce, was that I took over the household finances. Prior to this, my husband managed it. Unfortunately, due to the level of stress he was enduring at work, he had allowed the finances to fall by the wayside. Additionally, because his new job was through a contracting company, and I wasn&rsquo;t working at all, we had to find our own health insurance coverage.</p>
<p>What I inherited:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three open credit cards with balances</li>
<li>Nearly every bill was at least late, if not a month or more past due (including the mortgage)</li>
<li>Half of the bills on autopay, with no savings to speak of to prevent overdrafting</li>
<li>A new, upcoming bill for nearly $700/month total (premium + copay/deductible)</li>
<li>Half the income with which to fix it all, which fell about $700 short of the full financial requirement</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="step-1-write-everything-down">Step 1: Write Everything Down&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#step-1-write-everything-down"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h1>
<p>The very first thing I did was create a Google Spreadsheet, wrote down the name of the bill, the day of the month that it&rsquo;s due, the amount to pay (average for variable bills like gas and electric), and any notes about it (whether it&rsquo;s on autopay, whether it&rsquo;s a special financing deal, whether it&rsquo;s weird and is billed quarterly, whether it&rsquo;s overdue and by how much, etc). I then sorted them by the due date and applied some conditional formatting to highlight the ones with due dates within certain time frames, so that I can see at a glance whether something&rsquo;s coming due or whether I need to pay it right now.</p>
<p>In a new sheet in the file, I created a primitive &ldquo;cash flow&rdquo; sheet. On there, I put down the weekly income we were expecting from my husband&rsquo;s new job, assuming 40 hours (he&rsquo;s hourly now, but generally gets 40+ hours). I also aggregated the payment amounts from the first page of the file, and added rows for additional, non-bill expenses. You know, things like food, gas, savings, etc. Then, it all gets mathed together (<code>income-(bills+expenses)</code>) and I see where I come out at the end of the month (again, with a little conditional formatting to go red when <code>expenses &gt; income</code> and green when <code>expenses &lt; income</code>). I will tell you right now, the first couple of months of that were not pretty. The company hubby was contracted to being closed several days over the holiday (closed company == no pay for hubby) didn&rsquo;t help matters, especially since he was still training, so he didn&rsquo;t have anything to do while his trainer wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<h1 id="step-2-create-a-payoff-plan">Step 2: Create A Payoff Plan&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#step-2-create-a-payoff-plan"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h1>
<p>On a third sheet in the file (my file actually has 7 sheets in it, though a couple are defunct or only for calculation purposes), I listed out all of the bills that were loans/credit cards. This sheet had the name, the current payoff balance, the interest rate, and the minimum payment. This included all of the credit cards, the car loans, my student loans, and the mortgage. We were fortunate in that most of our stuff has low interest rates and we only had the three cards (two of which had fairly small balances), but it still wasn&rsquo;t particularly pretty. I then imported this <a href="http://www.vertex42.com/Calculators/debt-reduction-calculator.html">debt reduction calculator</a> into my spreadsheet (it was a bit of a pain in the ass, just be warned), to get an idea of what to pay off when, and how long it would take to do so.</p>
<h2 id="snowball-vs-avalanche">Snowball vs Avalanche&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#snowball-vs-avalanche"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>There are two common strategies for paying off debts &ndash; the snowball strategy, where you pay the lowest principle, first; and the avalance strategy, where you pay off the highest interest first. They&rsquo;re both the same idea &ndash; you pay as much extra as you can on one bill and only pay the minimum on the others. Once that target bill is paid off, you take the amount you were paying and apply it to the next bill. Either way is extremely powerful, because if I can follow it, I can have what started as over $230k in loans and credit cards paid off in less than 10 years (that includes the house, both cars, and my student loans), and I can be out of credit card debt in less than 5 years, with both cars following shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Now, some people say that avalanche is better than snowball, but I don&rsquo;t necessarily agree. I think it greatly depends on what your debt looks like. Avalanche works spectacularly if you have a lot of high-interest credit cards, and your larger debts are relatively low interest. But what if your smaller debts are low interest, interest-free, or at least lower interest than your large debts? If you go the avalanche route, you&rsquo;ll be paying on those little debts for the next several years, while you beat down a large debt. However, if you go the snowball route, you kill those little debts very quickly, freeing up the money to pay off the bigger ones, and/or switch to avalanche once you&rsquo;re dealing with debts that are more similar in length and/or interest rate.</p>
<p>The nice thing about the debt calculator I linked earlier, is that you can switch between methods easily and see which one works better for you. For example, for me, the difference is about $90, with no change in the final payoff date (in no small part, because the car loans run out within the next couple of years, anyway), but the snowball method kills all my credit card debt, first, dropping the number of bills to keep track of very quickly.</p>
<h1 id="step-3-find-ways-to-reduce-your-bills-immediately">Step 3: Find Ways To Reduce Your Bills Immediately&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#step-3-find-ways-to-reduce-your-bills-immediately"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h1>
<p>Admittedly, the lattes at the local hipster coffee shop were the first thing to go (<a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/save-on-coffee/">sorry, Ramit</a>, but our habit was pushing $50/week for the two of us that we legit couldn&rsquo;t afford), but my previous cash flow calculations didn&rsquo;t even include such indulgences (all of which got cut until we could manage the basics), so we needed to find other ways to cut the expenses.</p>
<p>Now, a number of people may have noticed that I&rsquo;ve mentioned cars, plural, and their first thought may be that we should sell one of them. After all, that would immediately knock out a $300-400 payment. Unfortunately, that isn&rsquo;t an option for us, because my son sometimes has behavioral troubles at school, which is over 4 miles away (with no public transportation that connects us, and on a rural route with no sidewalk and barely a shoulder to speak of), and my husband works on the other side of the city (and again, hourly, with no paid time off), so I have to be able to get to the school to pick him up. However, if you&rsquo;re looking to get out of debt or looking for ways to make ends meet, this may be a feasible option for you and is definitely worth considering. We do have the nice advantage of the fact that our car loans are very low interest rate. My car actually has a 0% interest rate (no joke), and my husband&rsquo;s is 2.9%, thanks to some strategic timing on our parts a couple of years ago, and they&rsquo;re both halfway or more through their loans. This makes trading down in order to get a lower payment a bit more limited after interest rates and the reset of the loan are taken into account.</p>
<p>One of the first things I did do, though, was put my student loans into forebearance. To be honest, this sucks in the long run, because I owe something like $80k+ with a 6% interest rate, so once I start paying again, it will have tacked on several hundred dollars. However, in the short term, it meant I could make the rest of the ends meet and bought me time to free up money in other areas. There&rsquo;s no easy choice in this situation, sadly.</p>
<p>One of the other things to do, too, is to get aggressive about interest rates and monthly payments for things like credit cards and internet/cable/phone bills. We were already pretty pared down when it came to internet/cable (since we cut the cord years ago), but calling the cable company about your bill is a common way of knocking $20+ off your bill (I think we dropped ours by about $50). Talking credit card companies down in interest rates makes paying them off easier, and often gets you a few dollars back, as well. Since the circumstances have changed regarding our cell data usage (we don&rsquo;t have a landline), I&rsquo;ll also be reviewing our account to see if a cheaper plan is viable for our usage (though at the moment, it appears that it would only save us about $5, due to offered plan changes).</p>
<h2 id="leverage-windfalls-to-pay-off-bills-or-reduce-payments">Leverage Windfalls To Pay Off Bills Or Reduce Payments&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#leverage-windfalls-to-pay-off-bills-or-reduce-payments"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>One of the most impactful things I was able to do was leverage the final profit sharing check my husband got from his previous employer, and the income tax check that we received for the previous year. These two windfalls allowed me to pay off the two smallest cards (dropped $3000 of debt, regained over $300/month, and dropped two bills off the schedule). The income tax also allowed me to greatly pay down the &ldquo;equipment installment plan&rdquo; that my cell phone carrier uses for paying for the phones, dropping that bill by nearly $60.</p>
<p>This tactic is especially useful if you have several small debts (for example, the two that I paid off were each around $1500).</p>
<h1 id="step-4-build-a-bill-paying-system">Step 4: Build A Bill Paying System&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#step-4-build-a-bill-paying-system"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h1>
<p>The details of how to go about doing this is going to depend on how you pay your bills. All of my bill pay is through my bank, so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to detail here.</p>
<h2 id="a-get-a-bank-that-doesnt-have-account-fees">A. Get A Bank That Doesn&rsquo;t Have Account Fees&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#a-get-a-bank-that-doesnt-have-account-fees"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>Many banks out there now that don&rsquo;t charge fees for personal checking or savings accounts. I personally really like Ally, because they don&rsquo;t have any fees for having accounts and their customer service has done very well by me. The important part here, though, is no fees for having an account (ideally, unconditionally no fees), because the system I use utilizes several accounts to handle things.</p>
<p>The one exception to this is Simple bank, which is built around a single account, but uses a &ldquo;Goal&rdquo; system to organize money. My system works with this kind of interface, and I actually use it extensively, as well. I still recommend a bank that doesn&rsquo;t charge fees for having an account, though, because the bank is already re-investing your money and making 3-4 times the amount you deposit, you don&rsquo;t need to be paying them for that privilege.</p>
<h2 id="b-set-up-financial-buckets">B. Set Up Financial Buckets&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#b-set-up-financial-buckets"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>In my Ally setup, I have a checking account that I call &ldquo;bill pay limbo,&rdquo; which is separate from my &ldquo;income&rdquo;/&ldquo;safe to spend&rdquo; checking account. I did this for a couple of reasons &ndash; 1. Some of the larger bills require saving up money over the course of the month (the joy of having both the mortgage and the health insurance due on the 1st&hellip;), and 2. bill payments don&rsquo;t always get deducted from the balance immediately at my bank, so both of these reduce the cognitive overhead of dealing with the money that&rsquo;s actually there. (Yes, I know how to run a ledger and balance a checkbook. Since I&rsquo;m not the only one withdrawing from the account, I prefer to use the tools the bank provides.)</p>
<p>I also have two savings accounts. The first is the actual &ldquo;savings&rdquo; account, which is for long-term savings. The goal for this account is to deposit money and not withdraw it until I&rsquo;m ready to invest it somewhere that has a better ROI than a bank savings account. The second account is my &ldquo;buffer&rdquo; account. It&rsquo;s the overdraft protection account that is shared between the income and limbo accounts. The goal there is to have enough to cover bills if/when income falls short. This should have, at minimum, a couple of hundred dollars, but would ideally have enough for a month&rsquo;s worth of bills. Splitting these savings accounts is optional, but I recommend it, so that you can use the savings to grow your wealth in the long run, without impacting your immediate buffer.</p>
<p>In my Simple bank setup, Goals take the place of different accounts. I use it to seed my business and fund our HSA account, so I have a couple of permanent goals &ndash; profit, HSA, and taxes. Then, I have other transient goals for various expenses that are incurred over the course of doing business. For a personal account, these goals can be things like &ldquo;savings,&rdquo; &ldquo;bill pay,&rdquo; and &ldquo;buffer.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c-immediately-fill-the-buckets-and-automate-it-if-possible">C. Immediately Fill The Buckets (And Automate It, If Possible)&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#c-immediately-fill-the-buckets-and-automate-it-if-possible"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>The next step is to fill those buckets, ideally automatically (if possible). For example, every Friday (weekly pay), I have $430 transfer to bill pay limbo, and $10 to savings. I get this number by adding up the entire month&rsquo;s of bills that have a due date and dividing by the number of paychecks per month.</p>
<p>(Confession: that amount is only the minimum required to pay health insurance and mortgage for me, I then manually move an additional $400 or so to the bill pay, this is because hubby is hourly, and it&rsquo;s happened a few times that he didn&rsquo;t have enough hours to break $800. However, if you&rsquo;re salary, go ahead and calculate how much you need per week to accumulate the amount necessary to pay the bills with due dates.)</p>
<p>Technically, Simple has the amounts automated, but it&rsquo;s a daily transfer, which I don&rsquo;t really like. So, I just do this manually. Each week, I go in and move the money to each of the buckets. On this one, I actually keep the &ldquo;safe to spend&rdquo; at 0, because everything gets earmarked (this is a little more difficult to do in the Ally setup, because things like food and gas vary so much).</p>
<p>What this does is earmark your money, so that you&rsquo;re less likely to spend it on impulse buys and can better create (and stick to) a budget. It also ensures your bills get paid.</p>
<h2 id="d-view-what-youre-actually-paying-during-the-month">D. View What You&rsquo;re <em>Actually</em> Paying During The Month&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#d-view-what-youre-actually-paying-during-the-month"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of <a href="https://www.waveapps.com/">Wave</a>, since it&rsquo;s free for personal and very small business use and includes a personal section for personal finances. However, Mint and other personal finance software works, too, and Simple has this built in. The important part here is that your transacations are all categorized, so that you can see what you spend where each month. This helps you find where things can be trimmed, as well as where you&rsquo;re spending less than you think. I come back to my Wave account at least once a month to ensure that I&rsquo;m still spending the amounts I expect, and I&rsquo;m not getting spending creep anywhere.</p>
<h1 id="where-i-am-now-and-the-future">Where I Am Now, And The Future&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#where-i-am-now-and-the-future"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done all this for the past several months, and have now paid off two cards, gotten us a little breathing room for some modest social spending (ie &ndash; dinner out a couple of times a month with friends or family), and am poised to start aggressively paying down the biggest credit card. At some point, I&rsquo;ll need to reactivate my student loans, but that&rsquo;s a bridge I won&rsquo;t need to cross until next year. In the meantime, I can grow my own income and work on paying down our debts. The goal I&rsquo;d like to reach by January is enough income to be able to also cover the student loans.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re just starting on the road to financial recovery, rest assured that you <em>can</em> get yourself out of debt. It takes time, and it seems daunting as hell at first, but it can be done. Just take it one step at a time, one day at a time, and once you get started, you&rsquo;ll be able to build momentum on your way to being debt free. :)</p>

                        <h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>I make stuff.</p>
<p>My profession is problem solving. My chosen tool by which to do that has been developing software. I&rsquo;ve written shell scripts, maintained systems in .Net, built APIs in PHP, and implemented interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I&rsquo;ve maintained legacy systems and built cutting-edge, life-changing applications, as well as created little tools to support other people in getting their work done.</p>
<p>Writing software isn&rsquo;t all I do, though. I like to write English words, too, and my writing is about as eclectic as my coding. While my blog started (ages ago) as a &ldquo;tech and work blog,&rdquo; it soon expanded out to other aspects of life, including personal finance and the broader culture. Maybe I&rsquo;ll spin some topics off to their own blogs, eventually.</p>
<p>Professionally, I&rsquo;ve been a software developer for over a decade, with particular focus in full stack, PHP-based (and more recently, Python-based) web development. I&rsquo;ve also picked up professional teaching over the past year or so. For more details about my experience, <a href="http://resume.shaunagordon.com/">visit my resume</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, I&rsquo;ve embraced what seems to be my fate as an independent consultant and I run my own software development shop, World Tree Limited, through which I provide various development services and plan to release my own software products.</p>
<p>Culture means a great deal to me, so it should come as no surprise that I hold it above all else when working with organizations and I have a fair number of words to say about the current broader culture here in the US, and they go hand-in-hand. I&rsquo;m a staunch advocate of equitable culture, both inside and outside the (proverbial or literal) office, and I&rsquo;m not afraid to lose &ldquo;opportunities&rdquo; (though I&rsquo;d argue such things are not my kind of opportunities) because of it.</p>
<p>Maybe that makes me <a href="https://unemployable.com/podcast/intro/">&ldquo;unemployable&rdquo;</a>?</p>
<p>Or perhaps it&rsquo;s a criticism of conventional workplaces and I&rsquo;ve just been <a href="https://www.gorowe.com/">ahead of the curve</a>?</p>
<p>&#x1f937;&zwj;&#x2640;&#xfe0f;</p>
<p>Regardless, it gives my mind the never-ending puzzle of finding better ways of supporting my family.</p>

<p>(Ways I Make Money From This Site)</p>
<h2 id="i-hate-ads">I <em>Hate</em> Ads&hellip;</h2>
<p>I do, with a passion. The first extension I install on any browser is AdBlock. That&rsquo;s how much I hate them. I also hate when blogs write a &ldquo;review&rdquo; or other article for the sole purpose of selling that product. You know the kind I&rsquo;m talking about. They read like a commercial and are full of keywords and buzzwords about the product. I can usually spot them a mile away and they annoy the crap out of me.</p>
<h2 id="and-paywalls">&hellip;And Paywalls&hellip;</h2>
<p>I also hate when content is stuck behind a paywall for no good reason. The primary purpose of my blog is to share my knowledge with my audience. While I have no problem with the &ldquo;freemium&rdquo; (or even just premium) model for applications, I&rsquo;m not keen on them for article-based sites &ndash; at least not for mine. I think information is best shared freely, especially when it comes to some of the topics I cover.</p>
<h2 id="but-running-blogs-cost-resources">&hellip;But Running Blogs Cost Resources</h2>
<p>It does, however, take time, money, brainpower, equipment, etc. (ie - resources) to write my posts and maintain this and my other sites. The holy grail of arguably any hobby is for it to pay for itself. Now, obviously, brainpower (mental energy) isn&rsquo;t a currency society can deal in (how cool would that be, though? And I&rsquo;m still waiting for the tech that would allow me to just download my stream of consciousness to my computer), but hosting and keeping my domain name do require monetary resources. As a result, I offer (and may, in the future offer more) various ways to help defray these costs.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-make-money">How I Make Money</h2>
<p>Since I don&rsquo;t do ads, and I don&rsquo;t do paywalls, I need to implement other avenues from which to bring in money. Those methods are detailed below.</p>
<p>All methods are completely optional and you are under no obligation to use any of them or give me anything. The hope, though, is that the content of my site (or maybe some other interaction you&rsquo;ve had with me) has provided you with such value that you <em>want</em> to give back somehow, and in those situations, I want to make it easy for you to do so.</p>
<p>Oh, and <strong>10% of my income goes to a charity or project each month.</strong> More about that later.</p>
<h3 id="donations">Donations</h3>
<p>An easy way to give back is simply giving money. You&rsquo;re free to donate whatever amount you wish. You can do that via <a href="https://ko-fi.com/shaunagordon">my Ko-fi page</a> for one-time payments, or via <a href="https://liberapay.com/Dreamwalker-Collective/">my Liberapay</a> page for recurring payments.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/ShaunaGordon">sponsor me through Github</a>, either one-time or on a recurring basis.</p>
<h3 id="selling-my-own-things-directly">Selling My Own Things, Directly</h3>
<p>I sell some of my own things, as well, since I have a couple other hobbies. The funds from those things help pay for my sites, as well (as well as meatspace supplies as needed).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://leanpub.com/u/ShaunaGordon">Leanpub</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(And Indirectly)</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also a gamer and like to tinker with <em>World of Warcraft</em> addons, in particular, but I technically can&rsquo;t make money from them directly (ie - I can&rsquo;t sell them), hence the name on the Liberapay account. <a href="https://dreamwalker-collective.github.io/">You can find those projects here.</a></p>
<h2 id="giving-back">Giving Back</h2>
<p>As I mentioned previously, 10% of my income is donated each month.</p>
<p>To whom I choose to donate in a given month is somewhat random (it&rsquo;s who I decide to donate to that month), and whether it&rsquo;s an official non-profit organization isn&rsquo;t of particular concern, because I&rsquo;m not doing it for the tax write-off. Instead, I do it for the sake of giving back. I work with a lot of open source software, and am part of a number of communities that would benefit from a little financial backing. So, I do what I can to show my thanks and help support them.</p>
<p>What projects/organizations do I donate to? Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)</li>
<li>Apache Foundation</li>
<li>Ansible</li>
<li>Vagrant</li>
<li>American Foundation for Suicide Prevention</li>
<li>Trevor Project</li>
<li>SAGE</li>
<li>Autism Self Advocacy Network</li>
<li>GoFundMe campaigns (usually for someone facing a hardship)</li>
<li>PCOS Foundation</li>
<li>Do Yoga With Me</li>
<li>Octoprint</li>
<li>Kickstarter projects, including:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1035100786/truenorth-php-woolly-mammoth-plush-toy">True North PHP</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2022042435/bula-batiki-coconut-oil-non-profit-from-the-fiji-i">The community of Bula Batiki, Fiji</a>, who are building sustainable income through the export of coconut oil</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1593368264/blessed-designs-ethically-made-t-shirts">Blessed Designs</a>, a trio of women of color starting a sustainably- and ethically-made (and comfy!) clothing company</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ankacoop/empowering-syrian-refugees-with-handcrafted-heirlo">Anka Cooperative</a>, empowering Syrian refugees by employing and training them to make hand-woven rugs</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/radian/the-perfect-everyday-jeans">Radian Jeans</a>, because pockets!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&hellip;and many others</li>
</ul>
<p>So, by helping me fund my projects, you&rsquo;ll also be helping me fund many other projects. :)</p>

                        <h1 id="hiring-me">Hiring Me</h1>
<p>Looking to work with me? Cool! Let&rsquo;s start with the type of relationship.</p>
<h2 id="what-type">What Type?</h2>
<h3 id="conventional-employment">Conventional Employment</h3>
<p>So you read through that &#x261d;&#xfe0f; and still want to hire me as a conventional employee? Well&hellip;it didn&rsquo;t scare you away, so that&rsquo;s a start.</p>
<p>For my sake and yours, I have a high bar for conventional employment in particular. Let&rsquo;s put it this way: I&rsquo;ve turned down Amazon roughly half a dozen times at this point.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;ll want to start by reading the posts in <a href="/tags/culture/">the &ldquo;culture&rdquo; tag</a>. Ideally, you&rsquo;ll want to read most of my blog, though the <a href="/categories/business/">business category</a> might be most relevant to you (ostensibly a recruiter or businessperson of some sort).</p>
<p>I also expect to get paid what I&rsquo;m worth. Don&rsquo;t bother sending me leads unless the base compensation is six figures.</p>
<p>Oh, and location-independent. I&rsquo;m not interested in relocating (so please don&rsquo;t ask), and while I don&rsquo;t mind going into the office periodically (after this whole Covid thing gets worked out; and what &ldquo;periodically&rdquo; means will depend on where &ldquo;the office&rdquo; is), I do best working where I&rsquo;m most productive.</p>
<p>I also have this snazzy office of my own, and I&rsquo;d hate for it to go to waste. &#x1f609;</p>
<h3 id="independent-consulting">Independent Consulting</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got some work that needs done, but don&rsquo;t need a full time employee for it? Awesome! Let&rsquo;s see if we&rsquo;re a fit!</p>
<p>First of all, let me make it clear: <strong>I run a business,</strong> I am <em>not</em> a &ldquo;contractor,&rdquo; especially when that means &ldquo;employee in all but name&rdquo; (aka &ldquo;defacto employee,&rdquo; which is questionably legal, by the way). The relationship is a business-to-business one. I may be one person, but the arrangement is like that of an agency. I control my time, location, and equipment (though I am flexible on where code lives for compliance purposes and whatnot, and of course meetings are part of the relationship).</p>
<p>Still with me? Cool. Let&rsquo;s talk business.</p>
<p>Because I generally do large projects where scopes are subject to changing, I typically bill by the hour. The logistics are flexible, though, and I generally do one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase set number of hours &ndash; this is useful for knocking out a backlog or other shorter-term situation</li>
<li>A time-boxed contract without set hours &ndash; this is typically the best for large projects where either I supply the team or I&rsquo;m embedded in your team</li>
</ul>
<p>Both contracts are renewable/extendable (subject to availability), because expectations inevitably change over time, and pricing is determined by the services required and the nature of the relationship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also open to the &ldquo;purchase hours&rdquo; part on a retainer basis.</p>
<h2 id="still-works-for-you-lets-talk">Still Works For You? Let&rsquo;s Talk</h2>
<p>The best way to get in touch is via one of the communication options at the top of the page.</p>
<p>To save us both time, please be sure to include the important information about the work you need &ndash; things like tech stack, scope of work, and timeline requirements are super helpful in gauging whether we&rsquo;ll be a technical fit.</p>
<p>For conventional employement, please include pay range and benefit information.</p>
<p>In all cases, down-in-the-weeds details aren&rsquo;t required, just that 10,000-foot view will be sufficient to start.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you!</p>

					<p>So, three months have passed since <a href="https://www.shipt.com/">Shipt</a> launched. So, how is it going?</p>
<p>Well&hellip; these Facebook posts are rather indicative:</p>
<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FShipttoday%2Fposts%2F541092312740359&width=500" width="500" height="180" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true"></iframe>

<h2 id="what-happened">What Happened?&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#what-happened"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>Well, they recently made a change to their algorithm for order offers, which has greatly upset a great number of the shoppers and even for those that aren&rsquo;t upset, it has altered how people schedule. Some people have removed themselves from the schedule out of protest, while others have done so out of necessity, so that their ranking isn&rsquo;t affected by missing offers while working at another job.</p>
<p>The end result, though, is the same (especially in smaller/newer cities like Columbus) &ndash; no open windows in which to place orders, and fewer orders offered to shoppers.</p>
<h3 id="whats-it-mean-for-me">What&rsquo;s It Mean For Me?&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#whats-it-mean-for-me"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h3>
<p>Columbus is a small market. It literally just launched three months ago, and after the initial launch, there hasn&rsquo;t been a whole heck of a lot of marketing around here. As a result, there&rsquo;s only a small, albeit rather loyal set of customers, and not much in the way of new customers. Some areas have more people and possibly more new customers, but overall, there aren&rsquo;t <em>that</em> many.</p>
<p>I relied on that loyal customer base, though. Very often, I&rsquo;d get the same half a dozen or so people, with one or two &ldquo;strays&rdquo; (of people to whom I don&rsquo;t often, if ever, deliver), and I had a rather steady income of around $100/week. It&rsquo;s not a lot, by any stretch, but it was enough to fund my HSA account and my soap business. It was literally the difference between crashing at a hotel in Cincinnati this past Friday night for a craft show on Saturday and getting up at 5am to drive down there. So no, not a lot, but enough.</p>
<p>Now, as a result of the recent changes, the number of orders I&rsquo;m offered has reduced dramatically. This is in no small part due the fact that there are days and times when I&rsquo;m the only one on the schedule (there need to be at least two on schedule in order for the window to be open to taking orders). I&rsquo;ve gone from 6-10 orders a week to as low as 1. If I get more, it&rsquo;s usually because I&rsquo;ve picked up orders elsewhere in the city, but even that is drying up, and both the shoppers and the customers enter a sort of &ldquo;death spiral&rdquo; &ndash; no one orders, because there&rsquo;s no one to shop the order, and no one shops orders, because no one orders.</p>
<h2 id="whats-going-to-happen-going-forward">What&rsquo;s Going To Happen Going Forward?&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#whats-going-to-happen-going-forward"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to hang on to Shipt for a while, yet. The flexibility can&rsquo;t really be beat, though I am starting to seriously consider <a href="https://www.lyft.com/cities/columbus">Lyft</a>, especially since I&rsquo;m not far from the airport, can work in the evenings, and could feasibly make a fair bit. I&rsquo;d like to try to ride out these bumps in the road and continue to provide feedback to the company. They have a great model and concept, but their execution just needs some work.</p>
<h2 id="so-whats-going-on">So What&rsquo;s Going On?&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#so-whats-going-on"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really say specifically without risking the terms of my employment contract with them, but that&rsquo;s exactly it &ndash; they are <em>very</em> opaque about just about everything. This most recent policy change was clearly something that was in the works for <em>months</em> and included technological changes that were implemented upwards of six weeks prior. At the time of implementation, we were assured that it was just for statistical purposes and it wouldn&rsquo;t affect the offer algorithm &ldquo;anytime soon.&rdquo; Well, apparently, &ldquo;anytime soon&rdquo; is code for &ldquo;within the next month,&rdquo; because about six weeks later, they gave us a &ldquo;head&rsquo;s up&rdquo; that it was going to start factoring into the offer algorithm.</p>
<p>Starting that following Monday.</p>
<p>That was two weeks ago.</p>
<p>There was supposed to be a follow-up providing more information. That follow-up has yet to come.</p>
<p>This has, unfortunately, been a pattern for the company, and it&rsquo;s only going to get worse as they grow (since they plan on adding something like 100 cities this year; or that was their goal at our launch). I even called them out on this lack of communication and transparency, and was met with the typical &ldquo;we try to be as transparent as possible&rdquo; corporate-esque answer. It&rsquo;s great that they &ldquo;try,&rdquo; but as Yoda put it so aptly, &ldquo;No. Try not. Do&hellip;or do not. There is no try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it can be done. <a href="https://buffer.com/transparency">Buffer does it</a>. Yep, it&rsquo;s hard. Yep, it&rsquo;s scary. I can pretty much guarantee those folks will say they and their company are better for it, though. Hell, they&rsquo;re not new at it, they&rsquo;ve been going strong with it <a href="https://open.buffer.com/transparency-timeline/">for over 5 years</a>. Since they recently bought Respondly, it&rsquo;s clearly working for them. And they are transparent about <em>everything</em>. Everyone&rsquo;s salaries, open source code, even projects that ultimately end up getting scrapped. It&rsquo;s all there for the whole world to see.</p>
<p>It sure as hell would help us shoppers out if we better understood the roadmap that this recent change is supposed to be the first step for. As it stands, we&rsquo;re just getting a bunch of stuff that impact our ability to make ourselves and the company money, and told &ldquo;trust us,&rdquo; while getting no information, or worse &ndash; incomplete information.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, this job was never intended to be a &ldquo;career&rdquo; for me. It&rsquo;s most definitely a stepping stone. A means to an end (that end being my own business). However, I was expecting it to last longer. Regardless of how <em>I</em> feel about how the company is handling its growth (both actual and planned), if I can&rsquo;t make money &ndash; especially for reasons beyond my control &ndash; then I&rsquo;m forced to look elsewhere.</p>

					<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>I make stuff.</p>
<p>My profession is problem solving. My chosen tool by which to do that has been developing software. I&rsquo;ve written shell scripts, maintained systems in .Net, built APIs in PHP, and implemented interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I&rsquo;ve maintained legacy systems and built cutting-edge, life-changing applications, as well as created little tools to support other people in getting their work done.</p>
<p>Writing software isn&rsquo;t all I do, though. I like to write English words, too, and my writing is about as eclectic as my coding. While my blog started (ages ago) as a &ldquo;tech and work blog,&rdquo; it soon expanded out to other aspects of life, including personal finance and the broader culture. Maybe I&rsquo;ll spin some topics off to their own blogs, eventually.</p>
<p>Professionally, I&rsquo;ve been a software developer for over a decade, with particular focus in full stack, PHP-based (and more recently, Python-based) web development. I&rsquo;ve also picked up professional teaching over the past year or so. For more details about my experience, <a href="http://resume.shaunagordon.com/">visit my resume</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, I&rsquo;ve embraced what seems to be my fate as an independent consultant and I run my own software development shop, World Tree Limited, through which I provide various development services and plan to release my own software products.</p>
<p>Culture means a great deal to me, so it should come as no surprise that I hold it above all else when working with organizations and I have a fair number of words to say about the current broader culture here in the US, and they go hand-in-hand. I&rsquo;m a staunch advocate of equitable culture, both inside and outside the (proverbial or literal) office, and I&rsquo;m not afraid to lose &ldquo;opportunities&rdquo; (though I&rsquo;d argue such things are not my kind of opportunities) because of it.</p>
<p>Maybe that makes me <a href="https://unemployable.com/podcast/intro/">&ldquo;unemployable&rdquo;</a>?</p>
<p>Or perhaps it&rsquo;s a criticism of conventional workplaces and I&rsquo;ve just been <a href="https://www.gorowe.com/">ahead of the curve</a>?</p>
<p>&#x1f937;&zwj;&#x2640;&#xfe0f;</p>
<p>Regardless, it gives my mind the never-ending puzzle of finding better ways of supporting my family.</p>

<p>(Ways I Make Money From This Site)</p>
<h2 id="i-hate-ads">I <em>Hate</em> Ads&hellip;</h2>
<p>I do, with a passion. The first extension I install on any browser is AdBlock. That&rsquo;s how much I hate them. I also hate when blogs write a &ldquo;review&rdquo; or other article for the sole purpose of selling that product. You know the kind I&rsquo;m talking about. They read like a commercial and are full of keywords and buzzwords about the product. I can usually spot them a mile away and they annoy the crap out of me.</p>
<h2 id="and-paywalls">&hellip;And Paywalls&hellip;</h2>
<p>I also hate when content is stuck behind a paywall for no good reason. The primary purpose of my blog is to share my knowledge with my audience. While I have no problem with the &ldquo;freemium&rdquo; (or even just premium) model for applications, I&rsquo;m not keen on them for article-based sites &ndash; at least not for mine. I think information is best shared freely, especially when it comes to some of the topics I cover.</p>
<h2 id="but-running-blogs-cost-resources">&hellip;But Running Blogs Cost Resources</h2>
<p>It does, however, take time, money, brainpower, equipment, etc. (ie - resources) to write my posts and maintain this and my other sites. The holy grail of arguably any hobby is for it to pay for itself. Now, obviously, brainpower (mental energy) isn&rsquo;t a currency society can deal in (how cool would that be, though? And I&rsquo;m still waiting for the tech that would allow me to just download my stream of consciousness to my computer), but hosting and keeping my domain name do require monetary resources. As a result, I offer (and may, in the future offer more) various ways to help defray these costs.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-make-money">How I Make Money</h2>
<p>Since I don&rsquo;t do ads, and I don&rsquo;t do paywalls, I need to implement other avenues from which to bring in money. Those methods are detailed below.</p>
<p>All methods are completely optional and you are under no obligation to use any of them or give me anything. The hope, though, is that the content of my site (or maybe some other interaction you&rsquo;ve had with me) has provided you with such value that you <em>want</em> to give back somehow, and in those situations, I want to make it easy for you to do so.</p>
<p>Oh, and <strong>10% of my income goes to a charity or project each month.</strong> More about that later.</p>
<h3 id="donations">Donations</h3>
<p>An easy way to give back is simply giving money. You&rsquo;re free to donate whatever amount you wish. You can do that via <a href="https://ko-fi.com/shaunagordon">my Ko-fi page</a> for one-time payments, or via <a href="https://liberapay.com/Dreamwalker-Collective/">my Liberapay</a> page for recurring payments.</p>
<h3 id="affiliate-program">Affiliate Program</h3>
<p>Another way to give back is to purchase things through my affiliate program. If I have something available that you are looking to buy, simply buy it through me, and I get a cut of the purchase at no extra cost to you.</p>
<p>This differs from ads in that the items and brands available via the affiliate program are ones that I&rsquo;ve used myself and would recommend. Additionally, they will only be linked to when I&rsquo;m actually talking about them. I figure that if I&rsquo;m going to review things and recommend them to my audience, anyway, I might as well provide them via an affiliate program.</p>
<h3 id="selling-my-own-things-directly">Selling My Own Things, Directly</h3>
<p>I sell some of my own things, as well, since I have a couple other hobbies. The funds from those things help pay for my sites, as well (as well as meatspace supplies as needed).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://leanpub.com/u/ShaunaGordon">Leanpub</a></li>
<li><a href="http://worldtreefarms.com">Soap Store</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(And Indirectly)</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also a gamer and like to tinker with <em>World of Warcraft</em> addons, in particular, but I technically can&rsquo;t make money from them directly (ie - I can&rsquo;t sell them), hence the name on the Liberapay account. <a href="https://dreamwalker-collective.github.io/">You can find those projects here.</a></p>
<h2 id="giving-back">Giving Back</h2>
<p>As I mentioned previously, <strong>10% of my income is donated each month.</strong> This is 10% off the top of my after-tax income, before other expenses.</p>
<p>To whom I choose to donate in a given month is somewhat random (it&rsquo;s who I decide to donate to that month), and whether it&rsquo;s an official non-profit organization isn&rsquo;t of particular concern, because I&rsquo;m not doing it for the tax write-off. Instead, I do it for the sake of giving back. I work with a lot of open source software, and am part of a number of communities that would benefit from a little financial backing. So, I do what I can to show my thanks and help support them.</p>
<p>What projects/organizations do I donate to? Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)</li>
<li>Apache Foundation</li>
<li>Ansible</li>
<li>Vagrant</li>
<li>American Foundation for Suicide Prevention</li>
<li>Trevor Project</li>
<li>Autism Self Advocacy Network</li>
<li>GoFundMe campaigns (usually for someone facing a hardship)</li>
<li>PCOS Foundation</li>
<li>Do Yoga With Me</li>
<li>Kickstarter projects, including:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1035100786/truenorth-php-woolly-mammoth-plush-toy">True North PHP</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2022042435/bula-batiki-coconut-oil-non-profit-from-the-fiji-i">The community of Bula Batiki, Fiji</a>, who are building sustainable income through the export of coconut oil</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1593368264/blessed-designs-ethically-made-t-shirts">Blessed Designs</a>, a trio of women of color starting a sustainably- and ethically-made (and comfy!) clothing company</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ankacoop/empowering-syrian-refugees-with-handcrafted-heirlo">Anka Cooperative</a>, empowering Syrian refugees by employing and training them to make hand-woven rugs</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/radian/the-perfect-everyday-jeans">Radian Jeans</a>, because pockets!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&hellip;and many others</li>
</ul>
<p>So, by helping me fund my projects, you&rsquo;ll also be helping me fund many other projects. :)</p>

<p>Looking to work with me? Cool! Let&rsquo;s start with the type of relationship.</p>
<h2 id="what-type">What Type?</h2>
<h3 id="conventional-employment">Conventional Employment</h3>
<p>So you read through that &#x261d;&#xfe0f; and still want to hire me as a conventional employee? Well&hellip;it didn&rsquo;t scare you away, so that&rsquo;s a start.</p>
<p>For my sake and yours, I have a high bar for conventional employment in particular. Let&rsquo;s put it this way: I&rsquo;ve turned down Amazon roughly half a dozen times at this point.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;ll want to start by reading the posts in <a href="/tags/culture/">the &ldquo;culture&rdquo; tag</a>. Ideally, you&rsquo;ll want to read most of my blog, though the <a href="/categories/business/">business category</a> might be most relevant to you (ostensibly a recruiter or businessperson of some sort).</p>
<p>I also expect to get paid what I&rsquo;m worth. Don&rsquo;t bother sending me leads unless the base compensation is six figures.</p>
<p>Oh, and location-independent. I&rsquo;m not interested in relocating (so please don&rsquo;t ask), and while I don&rsquo;t mind going into the office periodically (after this whole Covid thing gets worked out; and what &ldquo;periodically&rdquo; means will depend on where &ldquo;the office&rdquo; is), I do best working where I&rsquo;m most productive.</p>
<p>I also have this snazzy office of my own, and I&rsquo;d hate for it to go to waste. &#x1f609;</p>
<h3 id="independent-consulting">Independent Consulting</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got some work that needs done, but don&rsquo;t need a full time employee for it? Awesome! Let&rsquo;s see if we&rsquo;re a fit!</p>
<p>First of all, let me make it clear: <strong>I run a business,</strong> I am <em>not</em> a &ldquo;contractor,&rdquo; especially when that means &ldquo;employee in all but name&rdquo; (aka &ldquo;defacto employee,&rdquo; which is questionably legal, by the way). The relationship is a business-to-business one. I may be one person, but the arrangement is like that of an agency. I control my time, location, and equipment (though I am flexible on where code lives for compliance purposes and whatnot, and of course meetings are part of the relationship).</p>
<p>Still with me? Cool. Let&rsquo;s talk business.</p>
<p>Because I generally do large projects where scopes are subject to changing, I typically bill by the hour. The logistics are flexible, though, and I generally do one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase set number of hours &ndash; this is useful for knocking out a backlog or other shorter-term situation</li>
<li>A time-boxed contract without set hours &ndash; this is typically the best for large projects where either I supply the team or I&rsquo;m embedded in your team</li>
</ul>
<p>Both contracts are renewable/extendable (subject to availability), because expectations inevitably change over time, and pricing is determined by the services required and the nature of the relationship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also open to the &ldquo;purchase hours&rdquo; part on a retainer basis.</p>
<h2 id="still-works-for-you-lets-talk">Still Works For You? Let&rsquo;s Talk</h2>
<p>The best way to get in touch is via one of the communication options at the top of the page.</p>
<p>To save us both time, please be sure to include the important information about the work you need &ndash; things like tech stack, scope of work, and timeline requirements are super helpful in gauging whether we&rsquo;ll be a technical fit.</p>
<p>For conventional employement, please include pay range and benefit information.</p>
<p>In all cases, down-in-the-weeds details aren&rsquo;t required, just that 10,000-foot view will be sufficient to start.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you!</p>

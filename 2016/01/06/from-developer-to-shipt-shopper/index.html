					<p>Wait&hellip;what? I traded a lucrative programming career for&hellip;buying and delivering groceries?</p>
<p>In short, yes. For now, at least.</p>
<h1 id="simply-put----i-got-burned-the-f---out">Simply Put &ndash; I Got Burned The F&ndash; Out&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#simply-put----i-got-burned-the-f---out"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h1>
<p>I left my development job just before Thanksgiving. I all but literally told them &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not you, it&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; because that was the truth. I don&rsquo;t have anything but good stuff to say about the company I worked for, because they were about as close to perfect as I&rsquo;ve found. They really didn&rsquo;t care about the number of hours you worked, as long as you got the work done. They care about their employees (I went to the upper management a couple of times with some issues, and not only did they <em>listen</em> to what I had to say, they took it seriously and made change in order to fix the underlying problem). They valued employees' time and acted accordingly (kept meetings and interruptions to a minimum, had an unlimited paid time off policy, etc). The code, itself, is what burnt me out, really, and even that, had I been able to stick it out, probably would have resolved over time, as we modernized the legacy system.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, between the system, which was built in a way that was basically opposite to how I think and operate, so I was fighting my own brain the whole time, and various events going on at home, I pretty much crashed and burned. In the last couple of months of working, I became less and less able to do the work, and when I got off of work, I was so mentally exhausted that I couldn&rsquo;t function to do home stuff. It was all I could do to make dinner and put my son to bed in the evenings, let alone work on a side project that would allow me to apply to other companies that might suit me better (I didn&rsquo;t even want to look at computer after getting done with work). So, I made the decision to resign, for both the company&rsquo;s and my own sake.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now been a little over a month &ndash; a much-needed month off. I&rsquo;m actually getting back to a point where I can function, where the idea of doing just about any kind of work doesn&rsquo;t awash me in anxiety. I can, at the very least, open an editor and work on tech-related stuff, including working on this blog (both writing and hooking it up to Travis CI, so I can add posts from just about anywhere). I hope to be able to start working on actual development projects again in the coming weeks.</p>
<h1 id="changing-trajectory">Changing Trajectory&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#changing-trajectory"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h1>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve wanted to do for some time was run my own business. Since taking time off, I&rsquo;ve been able to focus on growing that part of my life. Right now, I&rsquo;ve focused on getting vendor opportunities for my soap business and craft projects. Over Thanksgiving, I was able to land a good deal with a small, but popular shop near my mom&rsquo;s house. It&rsquo;s actually been keeping me rather busy keeping up, since cold process soap requires a 6-week lead time. I actually need to work on expanding my production and curing stuff. I&rsquo;ve run myself out of room in my current setup!</p>
<p>It also uncovered a bit of a pain point in the soap making arena &ndash; the lack of production, inventory, etc. software. There is, as far as I can tell, one option out there, and it leaves quite a bit to be desired in the user experience department. So, I plan on working on an alternative option for it that serves three purposes for me &ndash; 1. it gives me an application to use that has the features I want/need, 2. it provides me with a code sample should I want to go back to working for someone else, and 3. it provides me with a potential source of income once I get it completed and up and running.</p>
<p>All of these things are long-game plans, though. It takes time to build an application (especially when you&rsquo;re the only one and you&rsquo;re designing and architecting <em>everything</em>), it takes time to build a vendor/customer list to sell to or through, and it takes time to get the money from those things. Unfortunately, when I quit working, I inherited most of the home-based things, which includes bills that were okay while both my husband and I were working for companies, but made finances tight when one salary dropped off. We&rsquo;re close to living off one salary, but need some extra cash sooner rather than later.</p>
<h1 id="enter-shipt">Enter Shipt&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#enter-shipt"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h1>
<p>As it so happens, a nifty little company out of Birmingham, AL was just about to expand into the Columbus area (in fact, today is launch day). <a href="http://shipt.com/">Shipt</a> is an on-demand grocery delivery service. The core company has built a platform where customers use their mobile app to order groceries, and shoppers go buy and deliver the groceries. They employ independent contractors to be the shoppers, though the salaried team at the corporate office also make a point to do at least one shop a month to ensure they don&rsquo;t get disconnected from their core model.</p>
<p>They do the contracting right, too &ndash; we set our own hours, limited only by the hours the grocery stores &ndash; and, by extension, Shipt &ndash; are open (they work with particular chains in each area to allow us to shop there, since Shipt is technically a &ldquo;reseller,&rdquo; so there&rsquo;s some paperwork that needs filed), we determine how many hours a day or week we work, we determine how many orders we can take on at once, we can even do our own advertising/marketing and whatnot (as long as we follow the branding guidelines).</p>
<p>Finally! A source of income I can do while my son is in school in the afternoons (he only goes half-days right now) and when my husband gets off work, that doesn&rsquo;t run me all night, and doesn&rsquo;t require me to do while my son is home (and, therefore, split my energy and force me to multitask by default). It&rsquo;s perfect! Now it&rsquo;s just a matter of picking up the orders so I can actually make money. Still, weekly pay as long as I fulfill at least one order, is still more frequent and more immediate than once every 4-6 weeks, and even more than 6+ months from now. It will definitely help smooth out the inherent rockiness of selling physical products of my own, and provides an avenue for some quick cash when necessary, as well as extra money to invest into building my company. Best of all, it&rsquo;s something that gets me out of the house, which is nice, and doesn&rsquo;t take a ton of brainpower, so it complements my coding work and doesn&rsquo;t interfere with it.</p>
<h1 id="the-future">The Future&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#the-future"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h1>
<p>I became a developer, because I loved writing code. I loved solving problems by making software. I want to be able to get back to that, because <em>working</em> as a software developer has largely lost sight of that core love of problem solving. Over the past several years, working as a software developer became less about solving people&rsquo;s problems with code, and more about completing tickets and meeting deadlines. Technically, the problem solving was still there &ndash; I last worked on software that <em>was</em> solving problems for people (I actually got to hear sometimes about how a new feature was a lifesaver to a particular client, those were awesome moments) &ndash; but I was thrice removed from those things. By the time it was my time to work, the solutions were dictated to me and expected to be done a certain way (even if the way wasn&rsquo;t always communicated to me).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not really what I want. I want the code itself to stay largely out of my way, and I want to spend my time <em>coming up with solutions to problems.</em> This is probably why I&rsquo;ve started getting into DevOps type of stuff lately (though, unfortunately, my path into that suffers the same issue my looking for work with other people suffered &ndash; certain requirements needed to be filled, but I didn&rsquo;t have the energy to fill them in).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that my software project will fulfill that need for me, while still allowing me to keep the software <em>industry</em> a bit more at arms-reach, so I don&rsquo;t get mired in its not-so-pleasant depths again.</p>

					<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>I make stuff.</p>
<p>My profession is problem solving. My chosen tool by which to do that has been developing software. I&rsquo;ve written shell scripts, maintained systems in .Net, built APIs in PHP, and implemented interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I&rsquo;ve maintained legacy systems and built cutting-edge, life-changing applications, as well as created little tools to support other people in getting their work done.</p>
<p>Writing software isn&rsquo;t all I do, though. I like to write English words, too, and my writing is about as eclectic as my coding. While my blog started (ages ago) as a &ldquo;tech and work blog,&rdquo; it soon expanded out to other aspects of life, including personal finance and the broader culture. Maybe I&rsquo;ll spin some topics off to their own blogs, eventually.</p>
<p>Professionally, I&rsquo;ve been a software developer for over a decade, with particular focus in full stack, PHP-based (and more recently, Python-based) web development. I&rsquo;ve also picked up professional teaching over the past year or so. For more details about my experience, <a href="http://resume.shaunagordon.com/">visit my resume</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, I&rsquo;ve embraced what seems to be my fate as an independent consultant and I run my own software development shop, World Tree Limited, through which I provide various development services and plan to release my own software products.</p>
<p>Culture means a great deal to me, so it should come as no surprise that I hold it above all else when working with organizations and I have a fair number of words to say about the current broader culture here in the US, and they go hand-in-hand. I&rsquo;m a staunch advocate of equitable culture, both inside and outside the (proverbial or literal) office, and I&rsquo;m not afraid to lose &ldquo;opportunities&rdquo; (though I&rsquo;d argue such things are not my kind of opportunities) because of it.</p>
<p>Maybe that makes me <a href="https://unemployable.com/podcast/intro/">&ldquo;unemployable&rdquo;</a>?</p>
<p>Or perhaps it&rsquo;s a criticism of conventional workplaces and I&rsquo;ve just been <a href="https://www.gorowe.com/">ahead of the curve</a>?</p>
<p>🤷‍♀️</p>
<p>Regardless, it gives my mind the never-ending puzzle of finding better ways of supporting my family.</p>

<p>(Ways I Make Money From This Site)</p>
<h2 id="i-hate-ads">I <em>Hate</em> Ads&hellip;</h2>
<p>I do, with a passion. The first extension I install on any browser is AdBlock. That&rsquo;s how much I hate them. I also hate when blogs write a &ldquo;review&rdquo; or other article for the sole purpose of selling that product. You know the kind I&rsquo;m talking about. They read like a commercial and are full of keywords and buzzwords about the product. I can usually spot them a mile away and they annoy the crap out of me.</p>
<h2 id="and-paywalls">&hellip;And Paywalls&hellip;</h2>
<p>I also hate when content is stuck behind a paywall for no good reason. The primary purpose of my blog is to share my knowledge with my audience. While I have no problem with the &ldquo;freemium&rdquo; (or even just premium) model for applications, I&rsquo;m not keen on them for article-based sites &ndash; at least not for mine. I think information is best shared freely, especially when it comes to some of the topics I cover.</p>
<h2 id="but-running-blogs-cost-resources">&hellip;But Running Blogs Cost Resources</h2>
<p>It does, however, take time, money, brainpower, equipment, etc. (ie - resources) to write my posts and maintain this and my other sites. The holy grail of arguably any hobby is for it to pay for itself. Now, obviously, brainpower (mental energy) isn&rsquo;t a currency society can deal in (how cool would that be, though? And I&rsquo;m still waiting for the tech that would allow me to just download my stream of consciousness to my computer), but hosting and keeping my domain name do require monetary resources. As a result, I offer (and may, in the future offer more) various ways to help defray these costs.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-make-money">How I Make Money</h2>
<p>Since I don&rsquo;t do ads, and I don&rsquo;t do paywalls, I need to implement other avenues from which to bring in money. Those methods are detailed below.</p>
<p>All methods are completely optional and you are under no obligation to use any of them or give me anything. The hope, though, is that the content of my site (or maybe some other interaction you&rsquo;ve had with me) has provided you with such value that you <em>want</em> to give back somehow, and in those situations, I want to make it easy for you to do so.</p>
<p>Oh, and <strong>10% of my income goes to a charity or project each month.</strong> More about that later.</p>
<h3 id="donations">Donations</h3>
<p>An easy way to give back is simply giving money. You&rsquo;re free to donate whatever amount you wish. You can do that via <a href="https://ko-fi.com/shaunagordon">my Ko-fi page</a> for one-time payments, or via <a href="https://liberapay.com/Dreamwalker-Collective/">my Liberapay</a> page for recurring payments.</p>
<h3 id="affiliate-program">Affiliate Program</h3>
<p>Another way to give back is to purchase things through my affiliate program. If I have something available that you are looking to buy, simply buy it through me, and I get a cut of the purchase at no extra cost to you.</p>
<p>This differs from ads in that the items and brands available via the affiliate program are ones that I&rsquo;ve used myself and would recommend. Additionally, they will only be linked to when I&rsquo;m actually talking about them. I figure that if I&rsquo;m going to review things and recommend them to my audience, anyway, I might as well provide them via an affiliate program.</p>
<h3 id="selling-my-own-things-directly">Selling My Own Things, Directly</h3>
<p>I sell some of my own things, as well, since I have a couple other hobbies. The funds from those things help pay for my sites, as well (as well as meatspace supplies as needed).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://leanpub.com/u/ShaunaGordon">Leanpub</a></li>
<li><a href="http://worldtreefarms.com">Soap Store</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(And Indirectly)</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also a gamer and like to tinker with <em>World of Warcraft</em> addons, in particular, but I technically can&rsquo;t make money from them directly (ie - I can&rsquo;t sell them), hence the name on the Liberapay account. <a href="https://dreamwalker-collective.github.io/">You can find those projects here.</a></p>
<h2 id="giving-back">Giving Back</h2>
<p>As I mentioned previously, <strong>10% of my income is donated each month.</strong> This is 10% off the top of my after-tax income, before other expenses.</p>
<p>To whom I choose to donate in a given month is somewhat random (it&rsquo;s who I decide to donate to that month), and whether it&rsquo;s an official non-profit organization isn&rsquo;t of particular concern, because I&rsquo;m not doing it for the tax write-off. Instead, I do it for the sake of giving back. I work with a lot of open source software, and am part of a number of communities that would benefit from a little financial backing. So, I do what I can to show my thanks and help support them.</p>
<p>What projects/organizations do I donate to? Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)</li>
<li>Apache Foundation</li>
<li>Ansible</li>
<li>Vagrant</li>
<li>American Foundation for Suicide Prevention</li>
<li>Trevor Project</li>
<li>Autism Self Advocacy Network</li>
<li>GoFundMe campaigns (usually for someone facing a hardship)</li>
<li>PCOS Foundation</li>
<li>Do Yoga With Me</li>
<li>Kickstarter projects, including:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1035100786/truenorth-php-woolly-mammoth-plush-toy">True North PHP</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2022042435/bula-batiki-coconut-oil-non-profit-from-the-fiji-i">The community of Bula Batiki, Fiji</a>, who are building sustainable income through the export of coconut oil</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1593368264/blessed-designs-ethically-made-t-shirts">Blessed Designs</a>, a trio of women of color starting a sustainably- and ethically-made (and comfy!) clothing company</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ankacoop/empowering-syrian-refugees-with-handcrafted-heirlo">Anka Cooperative</a>, empowering Syrian refugees by employing and training them to make hand-woven rugs</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/radian/the-perfect-everyday-jeans">Radian Jeans</a>, because pockets!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&hellip;and many others</li>
</ul>
<p>So, by helping me fund my projects, you&rsquo;ll also be helping me fund many other projects. :)</p>

                    <h1 id="hiring-me">Hiring Me</h1>
<p>Looking to work with me? Cool! Let&rsquo;s start with the type of relationship.</p>
<h2 id="what-type">What Type?</h2>
<h3 id="conventional-employment">Conventional Employment</h3>
<p>So you read through that ☝️ and still want to hire me as a conventional employee? Well&hellip;it didn&rsquo;t scare you away, so that&rsquo;s a start.</p>
<p>For my sake and yours, I have a high bar for conventional employment in particular. Let&rsquo;s put it this way: I&rsquo;ve turned down Amazon roughly half a dozen times at this point.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;ll want to start by reading the posts in <a href="/tags/culture/">the &ldquo;culture&rdquo; tag</a>. Ideally, you&rsquo;ll want to read most of my blog, though the <a href="/categories/business/">business category</a> might be most relevant to you (ostensibly a recruiter or businessperson of some sort).</p>
<p>I also expect to get paid what I&rsquo;m worth. Don&rsquo;t bother sending me leads unless the base compensation is six figures.</p>
<p>Oh, and location-independent. I&rsquo;m not interested in relocating (so please don&rsquo;t ask), and while I don&rsquo;t mind going into the office periodically (after this whole Covid thing gets worked out; and what &ldquo;periodically&rdquo; means will depend on where &ldquo;the office&rdquo; is), I do best working where I&rsquo;m most productive.</p>
<p>I also have this snazzy office of my own, and I&rsquo;d hate for it to go to waste. 😉</p>
<h3 id="independent-consulting">Independent Consulting</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got some work that needs done, but don&rsquo;t need a full time employee for it? Awesome! Let&rsquo;s see if we&rsquo;re a fit!</p>
<p>First of all, let me make it clear: <strong>I run a business,</strong> I am <em>not</em> a &ldquo;contractor,&rdquo; especially when that means &ldquo;employee in all but name&rdquo; (aka &ldquo;defacto employee,&rdquo; which is questionably legal, by the way). The relationship is a business-to-business one. I may be one person, but the arrangement is like that of an agency. I control my time, location, and equipment (though I am flexible on where code lives for compliance purposes and whatnot, and of course meetings are part of the relationship).</p>
<p>Still with me? Cool. Let&rsquo;s talk business.</p>
<p>Because I generally do large projects where scopes are subject to changing, I typically bill by the hour. The logistics are flexible, though, and I generally do one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase set number of hours &ndash; this is useful for knocking out a backlog or other shorter-term situation</li>
<li>A time-boxed contract without set hours &ndash; this is typically the best for large projects where either I supply the team or I&rsquo;m embedded in your team</li>
</ul>
<p>Both contracts are renewable/extendable (subject to availability), because expectations inevitably change over time, and pricing is determined by the services required and the nature of the relationship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also open to the &ldquo;purchase hours&rdquo; part on a retainer basis.</p>
<h2 id="still-works-for-you-lets-talk">Still Works For You? Let&rsquo;s Talk</h2>
<p>The best way to get in touch is via one of the communication options at the top of the page.</p>
<p>To save us both time, please be sure to include the important information about the work you need &ndash; things like tech stack, scope of work, and timeline requirements are super helpful in gauging whether we&rsquo;ll be a technical fit.</p>
<p>For conventional employement, please include pay range and benefit information.</p>
<p>In all cases, down-in-the-weeds details aren&rsquo;t required, just that 10,000-foot view will be sufficient to start.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you!</p>

					<p><strong>Hey-o! This is a really old post and no longer reflects what I do. I ended up going back to software development in October of that year. It was a nice break, but unfortunately, 2016 was also the year gig economy jobs as a whole kind of took a dump. This is here for posterity, though, to avoid broken links. Be sure to <a href="/2021/02/10/a-look-back-at-shipt">read the update</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JzuCGI5.gif" alt="The grocery deliverator from Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs 2. A young man throws produce into a portal and the produce comes out another portal onto his father&rsquo;s head."></p>
<p><small>Yes, this is basically what I do, minus the mess.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/5NKDd">gif credit goes to MisterNistal on imgur</a>)
</small></p>
<p>Last night, I hit deliverly number 9 with Shipt. One more, and I open up the ability to shop multiple orders at once (this is huge, because it increases the per-hour rate that I can make). Woot!</p>
<p>I also made $100 last week. Not bad for half a dozen deliveries over three days, and the first week of a newly-launched platform.</p>
<h2 id="so-whats-it-like">So, What&rsquo;s It Like?&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#so-whats-it-like"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot more fun than I expected. I think it&rsquo;s in large part due to the fact that I am once again on the front lines of helping people. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve come to realize that I missed. It actually outweighs the frustration I used to feel at going grocery shopping, especially during &ldquo;rush&rdquo; time (which is something I&rsquo;ve also noticed a marked decrease since going on hiatus from programming work).</p>
<p>You see, there are two prime demographics for Shipt: busy moms, and the disabled. You&rsquo;d be amazed at how quickly the older folks have jumped on this opportunity, since it&rsquo;s primarily on an app or website. Out of the 7 unique customers I&rsquo;ve had so far, 4 were disabled older people who were otherwise mostly or completely incapable of going grocery shopping. To see their faces light up when I arrive with their groceries is spectacular, because you just know it has made their lives better in untold ways.</p>
<h2 id="hows-the-shopping-part-work">How&rsquo;s The Shopping Part Work?&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#hows-the-shopping-part-work"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>The customer side is pretty straightforward &ndash; the customer peruses the online &ldquo;store,&rdquo; selects the items they want to order and in what quantities, and selects the delivery window that&rsquo;s available for them. They submit their order and wait, when it&rsquo;s delivered, they pay for the delivery in the app, where they also have the option to tip the delivery person (or they can tip them in cash or even in non-cash items; I know one shopper who got tipped in bacon!).</p>
<p>But how does it work on the shopper side? And how does the system ensure someone&rsquo;s available to fulfill an order?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty ingenious, really. Shoppers have to do two things to make themselves available to the system &ndash; they have to set their service area(s) and they have to set what delivery windows they&rsquo;re available to run.</p>
<h3 id="city-division">City Division&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#city-division"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h3>
<p>The metro area is divided into &ldquo;zones,&rdquo; or service areas the shopper can commit to serving. These zones run roughly along the suburb/district lines. So, for example, Gahanna, New Albany, and Hilliard are each their own zones. Some of the suburbs are combined into one zone, though. Blacklick, Whitehall, and Reynoldsburg are combined into one zone. How they came up with them, I&rsquo;m not totally sure, except maybe through average order size data combined with geographical size of the service area and location of the store that will serve the area. As far as I can tell, though, it&rsquo;s been working out pretty well.</p>
<p>Shoppers then set their default zones. They can select one or more, and it&rsquo;s encouraged to set up to three, which gives a good range for most cities (especially here in Columbus). Mine, therefore, are Gahanna, New Albany, and Blacklick/Whitehall/Reynoldsburg zones, since they&rsquo;re all easily accessible from my home. I know a couple of people who have Worthington, New Albany, and Gahanna, so there&rsquo;s some good overlap of coverage, ensuring availability in most areas.</p>
<h3 id="time-availability">Time Availability&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#time-availability"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h3>
<p>Then, there&rsquo;s the time aspect. As I mentioned in my previous post, shoppers are in full control over their hours. This is done by setting up the time availability in the schedule. It&rsquo;s encouraged to set times at least 24 hours in advance, so that people can order the day before if they choose. Shoppers setting their schedule up is the key to open delivery windows for the customers; they only get a given window option if shoppers have put themselves into the schedule for that zone and that time (I believe it has to be at least two shoppers for a given window in order to be available).</p>
<p>The time is for the <em>delivery window</em>, though, which is an important distinction. Shoppers need to remember to build time in for the actual shopping when considering their availability. I, for example, am available from 1pm to about 4pm on weekdays (while my son&rsquo;s in school), so I set my availability to the 2-3 and 3-4 windows, so I can be shopping during the 1 o&rsquo;clock hour.</p>
<h3 id="then-what">Then What?&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#then-what"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h3>
<p>Then, the shopper app (which is different from the customer app) alerts the available shopper that there&rsquo;s an order waiting to be claimed. The system prevents &ldquo;fights&rdquo; between shoppers by only offering an order to one shopper at a time (based in part on rank) for a 60-second window per shopper. If the shopper does not claim the order, it moves on to the next available shopper.</p>
<h4 id="what-happens-if-no-one-picks-it-up">What Happens If No One Picks It Up?&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#what-happens-if-no-one-picks-it-up"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h4>
<p>In some cases, none of the scheduled shoppers take the order in time for one reason or another. It&rsquo;s then opened up to anyone in the city that&rsquo;s scheduled for that time block. These are known as &ldquo;metro available orders.&rdquo; The metro orders are kind of like a &ldquo;free for all&rdquo; bucket. Anyone can grab them. This is step two in preventing orders from going unfulfilled. I&rsquo;ve done this twice, now. My very first order was a metro one, in fact. I picked another one up earlier this afternoon.</p>
<p>And what happens if an order <em>still</em> goes unclaimed? Then it gets a bounty if it&rsquo;s close to the order&rsquo;s delivery window. The bounty goes up the closer to or farther past the start of the delivery window the order gets (the bounty is useful for making up for the fact that the customer is not likely to add a tip to the order, since it&rsquo;s not the bounty-hunter&rsquo;s fault that it&rsquo;s late). The order is also forgiven for being delivered late, so the shopper does not get the late order marked against them.</p>
<h2 id="speaking-of-late-orders-how-are-shoppers-encouraged-to-be-on-time">Speaking Of Late Orders, How Are Shoppers Encouraged To Be On Time?&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#speaking-of-late-orders-how-are-shoppers-encouraged-to-be-on-time"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>Well, aside from the fact that late deliveries mean no tips and a customer that&rsquo;s less likely to return (fewer repeat orders = less money), it also affects the shopper&rsquo;s system rating. Orders are offered to shoppers in an automated order based on their experience (the number of shops they&rsquo;ve done), their rating (the average rating from customer feedback), and the percentage of deliveries that are on time.</p>
<p>In short, if you do a poor job, you get fewer orders offered to you. Fewer orders equals less money.</p>
<h3 id="but-what-about-those-bounties-how-do-they-stop-people-from-letting-it-go-to-bounty">But What About Those Bounties? How Do They Stop People From Letting It Go To Bounty?&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#but-what-about-those-bounties-how-do-they-stop-people-from-letting-it-go-to-bounty"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h3>
<p>For one, it plays off the fact that a lot of people who take this kind of job don&rsquo;t like seeing open orders, because open orders mean incomplete work and potentially unhappy customers. :D</p>
<p>Aside from that, putting oneself in the schedule and not accepting offered orders when you have no other orders affects your system rating, and if it is too chronic, you will be taken off the schedule. Also, a happy customer means they&rsquo;re more likely to tip better, and that better tip may be higher than the bounty.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-about-pay-and-how-does-shipt-make-money">So What About Pay, And How Does Shipt Make Money?&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#so-what-about-pay-and-how-does-shipt-make-money"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>Shipt, as a company, puts a small markup on the products it sells, just like any reseller. I&rsquo;m not privvy to the details on the markup, but the company says it averages out to about an additional $5 on a $35 order. For the stores that have a loyalty card that affects price (such as Kroger), they base their prices on the loyalty card price and shoppers use a loyalty card at checkout (yes, that means extra fuel points for shoppers).</p>
<p>Shoppers get paid an amount based off the order size. Right now, it&rsquo;s $5 + 7.5% of the order total + tips. According to my stats in the app, and including the cash tips (which the app stats doesn&rsquo;t know about), that has averaged out for me around $16-18 per order.</p>
<h3 id="what-thats-not-much">What? That&rsquo;s Not Much.&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#what-thats-not-much"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h3>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, that&rsquo;s not a lot per order, especially when you factor taxes in (it&rsquo;s a 1099 contract, so you&rsquo;re in charge of your own taxes), which brings your &ldquo;take home&rdquo; pay down to 70% of that, or about $12 per order. Orders generally take about 1-2 hours for total completion, so that&rsquo;s about $8-9 per hour. Better than minimum wage (for now), but still not <em>great</em>. It certainly isn&rsquo;t a developer&rsquo;s salary, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p><em>However,</em> once you&rsquo;ve done 10 orders, the system allows you to book multiple orders per delivery window. So, you shop more than one order at once, which makes your efficiency skyrocket, effectively giving you a raise that&rsquo;s unheard of in the corporate world. Taking a second order can net you half again as much or even double (they recommend combining small orders or a big and a small order, two big orders can be a bit too unweildy unless you&rsquo;re really experienced). It&rsquo;s a bit crazy, logistically, but there are experienced shoppers who routinely do <strong>four</strong> orders at once. Assuming they get the same $18 per order payout, that becomes <strong>$72 per shopping trip</strong>, or <strong>$36 per hour</strong> for a two-hour outing. Now <em>that&rsquo;s</em> a pretty good rate for what this is (if you assume an average of 20 billable hours a week, which is rather conservative in the busy areas, that works out to a little over $37k a year, not shabby for a part time gig).</p>
<h3 id="and-you-have-to-do-your-own-taxes">And You Have To Do Your Own Taxes?&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#and-you-have-to-do-your-own-taxes"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s a 1099 contract, so yeah. However, you can write so much off, it&rsquo;s not even funny. Your mileage, anything you buy to support it (like market carts, foldable wagons, or any kind of marketing materials), it can all be written off on your taxes as business expenses. I highly recommend learning about how business expense type stuff work and consider getting an accountant to help you out, and whether or you get an accountant or not, be sure to sign up on something like Expensify to keep track of your expenses, so you don&rsquo;t have to hoard paper receipts all year.</p>
<h2 id="okay-ive-been-long-winded-enough">Okay, I&rsquo;ve Been Long-Winded Enough&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#okay-ive-been-long-winded-enough"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>I could actually keep talking about it and how it works for the next couple of hours, but there&rsquo;s quite a bit here as it is. It&rsquo;s a ton of fun, and if you&rsquo;re looking for a side-gig with flexible hours, it&rsquo;s definitely worth looking into.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you&rsquo;d like to be a customer, <a href="http://mbsy.co/shipt/gordondev" class="affiliate" title="It's my ambassador link." alt="This is an amabassor link, like an affiliate.">click here to sign up through the website</a> or sign up in the app and enter promo code &ldquo;SHAUNAGORDON&rdquo; to get <strong>$10 in free groceries</strong>. How cool is that?</p>
<p>(If you&rsquo;re not currently in a Shipt service area, don&rsquo;t fret! They&rsquo;re looking to add 100 new cities this year, so it&rsquo;s worth stopping back to see if they&rsquo;ve launched in your city, or sending them an email to see if they have an ETA. You can also sign up to be alerted when Shipt will be launching in your city.)</p>

                        <h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>I make stuff.</p>
<p>My profession is problem solving. My chosen tool by which to do that has been developing software. I&rsquo;ve written shell scripts, maintained systems in .Net, built APIs in PHP, and implemented interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I&rsquo;ve maintained legacy systems and built cutting-edge, life-changing applications, as well as created little tools to support other people in getting their work done.</p>
<p>Writing software isn&rsquo;t all I do, though. I like to write English words, too, and my writing is about as eclectic as my coding. While my blog started (ages ago) as a &ldquo;tech and work blog,&rdquo; it soon expanded out to other aspects of life, including personal finance and the broader culture. Maybe I&rsquo;ll spin some topics off to their own blogs, eventually.</p>
<p>Professionally, I&rsquo;ve been a software developer for over a decade, with particular focus in full stack, PHP-based (and more recently, Python-based) web development. I&rsquo;ve also picked up professional teaching over the past year or so. For more details about my experience, <a href="http://resume.shaunagordon.com/">visit my resume</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, I&rsquo;ve embraced what seems to be my fate as an independent consultant and I run my own software development shop, World Tree Limited, through which I provide various development services and plan to release my own software products.</p>
<p>Culture means a great deal to me, so it should come as no surprise that I hold it above all else when working with organizations and I have a fair number of words to say about the current broader culture here in the US, and they go hand-in-hand. I&rsquo;m a staunch advocate of equitable culture, both inside and outside the (proverbial or literal) office, and I&rsquo;m not afraid to lose &ldquo;opportunities&rdquo; (though I&rsquo;d argue such things are not my kind of opportunities) because of it.</p>
<p>Maybe that makes me <a href="https://unemployable.com/podcast/intro/">&ldquo;unemployable&rdquo;</a>?</p>
<p>Or perhaps it&rsquo;s a criticism of conventional workplaces and I&rsquo;ve just been <a href="https://www.gorowe.com/">ahead of the curve</a>?</p>
<p>&#x1f937;&zwj;&#x2640;&#xfe0f;</p>
<p>Regardless, it gives my mind the never-ending puzzle of finding better ways of supporting my family.</p>

<p>(Ways I Make Money From This Site)</p>
<h2 id="i-hate-ads">I <em>Hate</em> Ads&hellip;</h2>
<p>I do, with a passion. The first extension I install on any browser is AdBlock. That&rsquo;s how much I hate them. I also hate when blogs write a &ldquo;review&rdquo; or other article for the sole purpose of selling that product. You know the kind I&rsquo;m talking about. They read like a commercial and are full of keywords and buzzwords about the product. I can usually spot them a mile away and they annoy the crap out of me.</p>
<h2 id="and-paywalls">&hellip;And Paywalls&hellip;</h2>
<p>I also hate when content is stuck behind a paywall for no good reason. The primary purpose of my blog is to share my knowledge with my audience. While I have no problem with the &ldquo;freemium&rdquo; (or even just premium) model for applications, I&rsquo;m not keen on them for article-based sites &ndash; at least not for mine. I think information is best shared freely, especially when it comes to some of the topics I cover.</p>
<h2 id="but-running-blogs-cost-resources">&hellip;But Running Blogs Cost Resources</h2>
<p>It does, however, take time, money, brainpower, equipment, etc. (ie - resources) to write my posts and maintain this and my other sites. The holy grail of arguably any hobby is for it to pay for itself. Now, obviously, brainpower (mental energy) isn&rsquo;t a currency society can deal in (how cool would that be, though? And I&rsquo;m still waiting for the tech that would allow me to just download my stream of consciousness to my computer), but hosting and keeping my domain name do require monetary resources. As a result, I offer (and may, in the future offer more) various ways to help defray these costs.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-make-money">How I Make Money</h2>
<p>Since I don&rsquo;t do ads, and I don&rsquo;t do paywalls, I need to implement other avenues from which to bring in money. Those methods are detailed below.</p>
<p>All methods are completely optional and you are under no obligation to use any of them or give me anything. The hope, though, is that the content of my site (or maybe some other interaction you&rsquo;ve had with me) has provided you with such value that you <em>want</em> to give back somehow, and in those situations, I want to make it easy for you to do so.</p>
<p>Oh, and <strong>10% of my income goes to a charity or project each month.</strong> More about that later.</p>
<h3 id="donations">Donations</h3>
<p>An easy way to give back is simply giving money. You&rsquo;re free to donate whatever amount you wish. You can do that via <a href="https://ko-fi.com/shaunagordon">my Ko-fi page</a> for one-time payments, or via <a href="https://liberapay.com/Dreamwalker-Collective/">my Liberapay</a> page for recurring payments.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/ShaunaGordon">sponsor me through Github</a>, either one-time or on a recurring basis.</p>
<h3 id="selling-my-own-things-directly">Selling My Own Things, Directly</h3>
<p>I sell some of my own things, as well, since I have a couple other hobbies. The funds from those things help pay for my sites, as well (as well as meatspace supplies as needed).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://leanpub.com/u/ShaunaGordon">Leanpub</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(And Indirectly)</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also a gamer and like to tinker with <em>World of Warcraft</em> addons, in particular, but I technically can&rsquo;t make money from them directly (ie - I can&rsquo;t sell them), hence the name on the Liberapay account. <a href="https://dreamwalker-collective.github.io/">You can find those projects here.</a></p>
<h2 id="giving-back">Giving Back</h2>
<p>As I mentioned previously, 10% of my income is donated each month.</p>
<p>To whom I choose to donate in a given month is somewhat random (it&rsquo;s who I decide to donate to that month), and whether it&rsquo;s an official non-profit organization isn&rsquo;t of particular concern, because I&rsquo;m not doing it for the tax write-off. Instead, I do it for the sake of giving back. I work with a lot of open source software, and am part of a number of communities that would benefit from a little financial backing. So, I do what I can to show my thanks and help support them.</p>
<p>What projects/organizations do I donate to? Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)</li>
<li>Apache Foundation</li>
<li>Ansible</li>
<li>Vagrant</li>
<li>American Foundation for Suicide Prevention</li>
<li>Trevor Project</li>
<li>SAGE</li>
<li>Autism Self Advocacy Network</li>
<li>GoFundMe campaigns (usually for someone facing a hardship)</li>
<li>PCOS Foundation</li>
<li>Do Yoga With Me</li>
<li>Octoprint</li>
<li>Kickstarter projects, including:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1035100786/truenorth-php-woolly-mammoth-plush-toy">True North PHP</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2022042435/bula-batiki-coconut-oil-non-profit-from-the-fiji-i">The community of Bula Batiki, Fiji</a>, who are building sustainable income through the export of coconut oil</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1593368264/blessed-designs-ethically-made-t-shirts">Blessed Designs</a>, a trio of women of color starting a sustainably- and ethically-made (and comfy!) clothing company</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ankacoop/empowering-syrian-refugees-with-handcrafted-heirlo">Anka Cooperative</a>, empowering Syrian refugees by employing and training them to make hand-woven rugs</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/radian/the-perfect-everyday-jeans">Radian Jeans</a>, because pockets!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&hellip;and many others</li>
</ul>
<p>So, by helping me fund my projects, you&rsquo;ll also be helping me fund many other projects. :)</p>

                        <h1 id="hiring-me">Hiring Me</h1>
<p>Looking to work with me? Cool! Let&rsquo;s start with the type of relationship.</p>
<h2 id="what-type">What Type?</h2>
<h3 id="conventional-employment">Conventional Employment</h3>
<p>So you read through that &#x261d;&#xfe0f; and still want to hire me as a conventional employee? Well&hellip;it didn&rsquo;t scare you away, so that&rsquo;s a start.</p>
<p>For my sake and yours, I have a high bar for conventional employment in particular. Let&rsquo;s put it this way: I&rsquo;ve turned down Amazon roughly half a dozen times at this point.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;ll want to start by reading the posts in <a href="/tags/culture/">the &ldquo;culture&rdquo; tag</a>. Ideally, you&rsquo;ll want to read most of my blog, though the <a href="/categories/business/">business category</a> might be most relevant to you (ostensibly a recruiter or businessperson of some sort).</p>
<p>I also expect to get paid what I&rsquo;m worth. Don&rsquo;t bother sending me leads unless the base compensation is six figures.</p>
<p>Oh, and location-independent. I&rsquo;m not interested in relocating (so please don&rsquo;t ask), and while I don&rsquo;t mind going into the office periodically (after this whole Covid thing gets worked out; and what &ldquo;periodically&rdquo; means will depend on where &ldquo;the office&rdquo; is), I do best working where I&rsquo;m most productive.</p>
<p>I also have this snazzy office of my own, and I&rsquo;d hate for it to go to waste. &#x1f609;</p>
<h3 id="independent-consulting">Independent Consulting</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got some work that needs done, but don&rsquo;t need a full time employee for it? Awesome! Let&rsquo;s see if we&rsquo;re a fit!</p>
<p>First of all, let me make it clear: <strong>I run a business,</strong> I am <em>not</em> a &ldquo;contractor,&rdquo; especially when that means &ldquo;employee in all but name&rdquo; (aka &ldquo;defacto employee,&rdquo; which is questionably legal, by the way). The relationship is a business-to-business one. I may be one person, but the arrangement is like that of an agency. I control my time, location, and equipment (though I am flexible on where code lives for compliance purposes and whatnot, and of course meetings are part of the relationship).</p>
<p>Still with me? Cool. Let&rsquo;s talk business.</p>
<p>Because I generally do large projects where scopes are subject to changing, I typically bill by the hour. The logistics are flexible, though, and I generally do one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase set number of hours &ndash; this is useful for knocking out a backlog or other shorter-term situation</li>
<li>A time-boxed contract without set hours &ndash; this is typically the best for large projects where either I supply the team or I&rsquo;m embedded in your team</li>
</ul>
<p>Both contracts are renewable/extendable (subject to availability), because expectations inevitably change over time, and pricing is determined by the services required and the nature of the relationship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also open to the &ldquo;purchase hours&rdquo; part on a retainer basis.</p>
<h2 id="still-works-for-you-lets-talk">Still Works For You? Let&rsquo;s Talk</h2>
<p>The best way to get in touch is via one of the communication options at the top of the page.</p>
<p>To save us both time, please be sure to include the important information about the work you need &ndash; things like tech stack, scope of work, and timeline requirements are super helpful in gauging whether we&rsquo;ll be a technical fit.</p>
<p>For conventional employement, please include pay range and benefit information.</p>
<p>In all cases, down-in-the-weeds details aren&rsquo;t required, just that 10,000-foot view will be sufficient to start.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you!</p>

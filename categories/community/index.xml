      <description>&lt;p&gt;Holy shit, I &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; just did a talk&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;in front of&amp;rdquo; a few hundred people&amp;hellip;for over an hour&amp;hellip; &amp;#x1f631;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure you, dear reader, fully grasp the gravity of that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See, fear of public speaking/stage fright (aka &amp;ldquo;glossophobia&amp;rdquo;) has been a thing that&amp;rsquo;s haunted me for&amp;hellip;basically my entire life. Incessant school bullying and an emotionally abusive head-of-household with a particular enjoyment of telling a 7 year old child everything they did wrong during the school performance, plus dealing with the fallout from a spouse&amp;rsquo;s undiagnosed mental illness will kind of do that to a person.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Rejection and Mental Health</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was turned down for a job today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is nothing new. I&amp;rsquo;ve been turned down for jobs before. Hell, I&amp;rsquo;ve done the job hunt thing on a near-annual basis, which pretty much inevitably results in at least one application rejection per cycle. I&amp;rsquo;ve had so many that I&amp;rsquo;ve dealt with such rejections at nearly every step of the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There weren&amp;rsquo;t even a lot of stakes for this job. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking (and was even actively &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; looking) when it fell into my lap. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; the job (which changed the entire feel of the interviews even more than I anticipated).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What We Owe To Each Other</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The topic of changing verbiage within the tech industry, particularly as it relates to references to &amp;ldquo;master,&amp;rdquo; particularly in the &amp;ldquo;master/slave&amp;rdquo; contexts, but also in places like &amp;ldquo;master&amp;rdquo; branch in git (which does, in fact, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2019-May/msg00066.html&#34;&gt;have its roots in the &amp;ldquo;master/slave&amp;rdquo; paradigm&lt;/a&gt;), came up in a couple of Slack groups in which I participate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s certainly not new (some discussions on the matter date back a decade or more), but it&amp;rsquo;s always kind of a contentious topic when it comes up, despite the terminology getting phased out over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Riot Is the Language of the Unheard</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I attended a protest the other day. It was the first time I&amp;rsquo;d been downtown since it started and I had walked there (and back) from one of the suburbs. A nearly 5 mile walk each way, with the inner-most mile or two containing a lot of plywood covering up a lot of damage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But you know what stuck out to me? Two things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Which places were hit.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Of the places that were damaged and thus boarded up, which had murals and which had graffiti.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These two things speak volumes about the situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Autism Awareness And The Blue Ranger</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2018/04/01/autism-awareness-and-the-blue-ranger/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the start of &amp;ldquo;Autism Awareness Month,&amp;rdquo; which, for those of us &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; Autism, tends to be &amp;ldquo;the month to run and hide and wish I didn&amp;rsquo;t like blue, because we get inundated with neurotypical people who think they know our experience better than we do.&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t often write about the effect of Autism on my life (either my son&amp;rsquo;s or my own&amp;rsquo;s), because to be honest, 99% of the time, it&amp;rsquo;s boring and uneventful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

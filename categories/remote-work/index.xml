      <description>&lt;p&gt;Among my many blog post drafts, I have a satirical piece that was originally intended to turn all the &amp;ldquo;remote working is inferior [because it&amp;rsquo;s a new thing with a learning curve]&amp;rdquo; stuff on its head.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;And then COVID-19 happened and pretty much overnight, just about everyone suddenly had to do at least some things remotely (even if work wasn&amp;rsquo;t one of them).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Schools are all now done in distance learning format (hat-tip to all of the school staff who busted their tails to make that pivot and get students of all ages going with relatively little disruption!). Zoom, Hangouts, and all the other video conference services are flooded with new people setting up every meeting, conference, non-meeting gathering, meetup, and social time under the sun. ISPs are getting bitch-slapped for not maintaining or upgrading their last-mile lines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to most of my other posts, I plan to update this one periodically as things change and this is still current. Check back periodically for updates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are you a business owner or manager? Have a look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://remotewave.io/blog/the-emergency-remote-work-guide/&#34;&gt;Remotewave.io&amp;rsquo;s guide,&lt;/a&gt; which approaches it from your side. :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well&amp;hellip;now that half the world is in quarantine of some level, a great many people are suddenly finding themselves tossed head first in the deep end of remote working. Odds are pretty good neither them nor their employers are really prepared for this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I posted my &lt;a href=&#34;http://shaunagordon.com/2014/10/15/dear-recruiters/&#34;&gt;open letter to recruiters&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a number of people speaking out against it (&amp;ldquo;against&amp;rdquo; used loosely here, ranging from &amp;ldquo;employees &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to be in the office&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the best companies hire the best people and the best people &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to go into the office&amp;rdquo; (that&amp;rsquo;s not insulting &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;) to &amp;ldquo;working remotely is isolating&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;in-person communication is better&amp;rdquo;). I decided to address a few of these things head-on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Adventures in Modernizing React</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent the better part of my first year at Custom Ink upgrading an Electron and React application. That was an adventure unto itself, let me tell you. It also resulted in a list of &amp;ldquo;things I need to do when my priority isn&amp;rsquo;t just get this thing working again to unblock the other team.&amp;rdquo; Among that list was updating the code to modern standards &amp;ndash; something I got to make a bunch of headway on in the second half of my second year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Open 3D Engine</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting a new gig is very often described as &amp;ldquo;drinking from the fire hose,&amp;rdquo; and for good reason &amp;ndash; the primary job for a new person for the first few months is simply taking in everything about the job, the work, the people, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have proceeded to jack that up to eleven.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why get just a new job, when I can get a new job, in an industry I&amp;rsquo;ve never worked in, working in a language I&amp;rsquo;ve never touched?!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fixing The Google Sheets View Only Bug</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been using Google Sheets on your Android or iPhone, then suddenly find a sheet that you own stuck in read only mode? Or maybe you opened it to find a message that says &amp;ldquo;this document has changed significantly. Reload to sync,&amp;rdquo; and then it goes read only?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have. It&amp;rsquo;s annoying as hell, and made yet more annoying by the fact that not a single help forum seems to acknowledge this is even an issue! I have found some half a dozen posts dating back to 2019 with the same symptoms and the same brain-dead &amp;ldquo;answers&amp;rdquo; and &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; of them actually fix the problem!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>That One Where I Talk For An Hour</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Holy shit, I &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; just did a talk&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;in front of&amp;rdquo; a few hundred people&amp;hellip;for over an hour&amp;hellip; &amp;#x1f631;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure you, dear reader, fully grasp the gravity of that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See, fear of public speaking/stage fright (aka &amp;ldquo;glossophobia&amp;rdquo;) has been a thing that&amp;rsquo;s haunted me for&amp;hellip;basically my entire life. Incessant school bullying and an emotionally abusive head-of-household with a particular enjoyment of telling a 7 year old child everything they did wrong during the school performance, plus dealing with the fallout from a spouse&amp;rsquo;s undiagnosed mental illness will kind of do that to a person.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Problem Solving</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2020/10/21/on-problem-solving/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most important skill in tech isn&amp;rsquo;t the technology. It&amp;rsquo;s problem-solving. Whether you get into cyber security, system administration, or programming, the heart of all of it is really the ability to take a problem, break it apart, and work out a solution &amp;ndash; very often coming up with solutions that didn&amp;rsquo;t previously exist at all. Even on the more everyday scale, you&amp;rsquo;ll be constantly faced with error messages, odd software behavior, broken tests, and more that you&amp;rsquo;ll be expected to triage and if not fix yourself, hand off detailed information about the problem to those who can fix it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What We Owe To Each Other</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2020/07/02/what-we-owe-to-each-other/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The topic of changing verbiage within the tech industry, particularly as it relates to references to &amp;ldquo;master,&amp;rdquo; particularly in the &amp;ldquo;master/slave&amp;rdquo; contexts, but also in places like &amp;ldquo;master&amp;rdquo; branch in git (which does, in fact, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2019-May/msg00066.html&#34;&gt;have its roots in the &amp;ldquo;master/slave&amp;rdquo; paradigm&lt;/a&gt;), came up in a couple of Slack groups in which I participate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s certainly not new (some discussions on the matter date back a decade or more), but it&amp;rsquo;s always kind of a contentious topic when it comes up, despite the terminology getting phased out over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pelican, Travis, and Github, Part 2</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2017/09/01/pelican-travis-and-github-part-2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, I wrote a post on &lt;a href=&#34;http://shaunagordon.com/2016/01/13/pelican-travis-and-github/&#34;&gt;automating the generation of my static-site blog&lt;/a&gt;. As they do, things have since changed, and I figured I&amp;rsquo;d update accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;changes-to-travis-and-travisyml&#34;&gt;Changes To Travis And .travis.yml&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Travis recently made several updates, many of which make our job easier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;build-settings&#34;&gt;Build Settings&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Travis now has the option to build only if a .travis.yml file is present. Before, you needed a .travis.yml file in both your source and your display branch. Now, that&amp;rsquo;s no longer the case.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shopify HMAC Verification</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2017/08/24/shopify-hmac-verification/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote class=&#34;alert alert-important&#34;&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p class=&#34;alert-heading&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;strong&gt;&#xA;        ℹ️&#xA;        &#xA;          Important&#xA;        &#xA;        &lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p&gt;If the date doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it evident, this is an old post. In the intervening years, Shopify has made a lot of changes, including a recent heavy overhaul. I&amp;rsquo;m leaving this up for posterity, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know or guarantee that it still works in light of those changes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I get the pleasure of writing integration after integration to Shopify at my day job. As a result, I have become quite familiar with their documentation and its gaps. The HMAC verification piece of the OAuth/embedded app installation process is a particularly glaring gap. So let&amp;rsquo;s close it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hey-o! There have been some changes made to this process. &lt;a href=&#34;http://shaunagordon.com/2017/09/01/pelican-travis-and-github&#34;&gt;Be sure to check out the updates.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is actually the second time I&amp;rsquo;ve leveraged &lt;a href=&#34;https://travis-ci.org/&#34;&gt;Travis CI&lt;/a&gt; for managing my static-site blog, but apparently I didn&amp;rsquo;t write about it. I had done it shortly after setting up the Octopress version of my blog. It was nice and convenient, and dramatically lowered the barrier to writing more blog entries, though I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that until I lost that capability when I switched to Pelican (probably because the Octopress version was a bit finicky, due to breaking changes in the upstream Octopress repo, so the barrier was still pretty high).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An Open Letter To Recruiters</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2014/10/15/dear-recruiters/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Third Party Recruiters,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Due to the high volume of contact requests I’ve received, I have decided to write this open letter in order to improve the quality of my network.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Greater Columbus Area is home to a very large number of third party recruiting companies. This means &lt;strong&gt;you have a lot of competition&lt;/strong&gt;. Competition should mean improved quality. Unfortunately, what I generally see is rather disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We tech folks are generally a merit-based people. We’ll respect you if we have reason to do so. You can earn that respect by demonstrating that you respect us and what we do (and no, saying that you do doesn’t cut it; show, don’t tell). Here are some ways to do that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

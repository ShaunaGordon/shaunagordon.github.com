      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve more actively sought out leadership positions, one of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about is the concept of core values. I see them actually communicated most often at the organization level, but I believe we have them at a personal level, too. We just don&amp;rsquo;t codify them. I like documenting things (because I like understanding), and since these are things I&amp;rsquo;d like to instill in the people I mentor and lead, I figured it&amp;rsquo;d be good to write them out and start documenting and exploring, and ultimately refining them.</description>

      <description>I got an invite from Cal Evans to watch this week&amp;rsquo;s episode of his weekly show, with this week&amp;rsquo;s topic being a public speaking Q&amp;amp;A with Adam Culp (as this is the third time Cal has pinged me regarding public speaking, I think he really wants me to start ðŸ˜®). It got me thinking again about my feelings toward the prospect of public speaking for me.
Espeically when it&amp;rsquo;s for larger audiences, my knee-jerk response to &amp;ldquo;you should give a talk,&amp;rdquo; has historically been &amp;ldquo;hell no.</description>

      <title>Companies are not family</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re a family here!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How many times have you heard that from your boss? Or perhaps even the CEO of your company? I&amp;rsquo;ve heard it at nearly every company I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for. And I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;its-a-trap&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s A Trap&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://shaunagordon.com/images/bait-thats-bait.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Tom Hardy in Mad Max shaking his head no, &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s bait&amp;rdquo;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I considered the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; meme, but I like this one better.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do you call a familial relationship in which one person controls another&amp;rsquo;s financial security in order to gain compliance?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Look Back At Shipt</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2021/02/10/a-look-back-at-shipt/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shaunagordon.com/2021/02/10/a-look-back-at-shipt/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I happened to notice the other day that my site gets a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more traffic than I realized (thanks, PointHQ!), so I tossed a little, lightweight analytics thing onto it so I can see where people are going and maybe we&amp;rsquo;re they&amp;rsquo;re coming from. (Hi, people! &amp;#x1f44b;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the things I noticed was that &lt;a href=&#34;http://shaunagordon.com/2016/01/13/a-week-of-shipt&#34;&gt;an old, &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; blog post&lt;/a&gt; of mine was getting hit. Like&amp;hellip;so old that I didn&amp;rsquo;t migrate it originally, considering it defunct and no longer applicable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Adventures In A Remote World</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2020/05/03/adventures-in-a-remote-world/</link>

      <guid>http://shaunagordon.com/2020/05/03/adventures-in-a-remote-world/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Among my many blog post drafts, I have a satirical piece that was originally intended to turn all the &amp;ldquo;remote working is inferior [because it&amp;rsquo;s a new thing with a learning curve]&amp;rdquo; stuff on its head.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;And then COVID-19 happened and pretty much overnight, just about everyone suddenly had to do at least some things remotely (even if work wasn&amp;rsquo;t one of them).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Schools are all now done in distance learning format (hat-tip to all of the school staff who busted their tails to make that pivot and get students of all ages going with relatively little disruption!). Zoom, Hangouts, and all the other video conference services are flooded with new people setting up every meeting, conference, non-meeting gathering, meetup, and social time under the sun. ISPs are getting bitch-slapped for not maintaining or upgrading their last-mile lines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to most of my other posts, I plan to update this one periodically as things change and this is still current. Check back periodically for updates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are you a business owner or manager? Have a look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://remotewave.io/blog/the-emergency-remote-work-guide/&#34;&gt;Remotewave.io&amp;rsquo;s guide,&lt;/a&gt; which approaches it from your side. :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well&amp;hellip;now that half the world is in quarantine of some level, a great many people are suddenly finding themselves tossed head first in the deep end of remote working. Odds are pretty good neither them nor their employers are really prepared for this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Being A Shiptster, Three Months In</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2016/04/18/being-a-shiptster-three-months-in/</link>

      <guid>http://shaunagordon.com/2016/04/18/being-a-shiptster-three-months-in/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, three months have passed since &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.shipt.com/&#34;&gt;Shipt&lt;/a&gt; launched. So, how is it going?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well&amp;hellip; these Facebook posts are rather indicative:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FShipttoday%2Fposts%2F541092312740359&amp;width=500&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;180&#34; style=&#34;border:none;overflow:hidden&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowTransparency=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FShipttoday%2Fposts%2F540685849447672&amp;width=500&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;161&#34; style=&#34;border:none;overflow:hidden&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowTransparency=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-happened&#34;&gt;What Happened?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, they recently made a change to their algorithm for order offers, which has greatly upset a great number of the shoppers and even for those that aren&amp;rsquo;t upset, it has altered how people schedule. Some people have removed themselves from the schedule out of protest, while others have done so out of necessity, so that their ranking isn&amp;rsquo;t affected by missing offers while working at another job.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Week Of Shipt</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2016/01/13/a-week-of-shipt/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hey-o! This is a really old post and no longer reflects what I do. I ended up going back to software development in October of that year. It was a nice break, but unfortunately, 2016 was also the year gig economy jobs as a whole kind of took a dump. This is here for posterity, though, to avoid broken links. Be sure to &lt;a href=&#34;http://shaunagordon.com/2021/02/10/a-look-back-at-shipt&#34;&gt;read the update&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/JzuCGI5.gif&#34; alt=&#34;The grocery deliverator from Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs 2. A young man throws produce into a portal and the produce comes out another portal onto his father&amp;rsquo;s head.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;whats-this-strengths-finding-thing&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s This Strengths Finding Thing?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of podcasts lately. I&amp;rsquo;m particularly a fan of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/&#34;&gt;Smart Passive Income&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://screwtheninetofive.com/&#34;&gt;Screw The Nine To Five&lt;/a&gt;. They&amp;rsquo;re both great podcasts for learning about how to build your own business in order to generate income that&amp;rsquo;s not dependent on trading your time for money. They&amp;rsquo;re a gold mine of various resources, not just for starting and running one&amp;rsquo;s own business, but for business and life stuff in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From Developer to Shipt Shopper</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2016/01/06/from-developer-to-shipt-shopper/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wait&amp;hellip;what? I traded a lucrative programming career for&amp;hellip;buying and delivering groceries?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, yes. For now, at least.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;simply-put----i-got-burned-the-f---out&#34;&gt;Simply Put &amp;ndash; I Got Burned The F&amp;ndash; Out&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I left my development job just before Thanksgiving. I all but literally told them &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not you, it&amp;rsquo;s me,&amp;rdquo; because that was the truth. I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything but good stuff to say about the company I worked for, because they were about as close to perfect as I&amp;rsquo;ve found. They really didn&amp;rsquo;t care about the number of hours you worked, as long as you got the work done. They care about their employees (I went to the upper management a couple of times with some issues, and not only did they &lt;em&gt;listen&lt;/em&gt; to what I had to say, they took it seriously and made change in order to fix the underlying problem). They valued employees&amp;rsquo; time and acted accordingly (kept meetings and interruptions to a minimum, had an unlimited paid time off policy, etc). The code, itself, is what burnt me out, really, and even that, had I been able to stick it out, probably would have resolved over time, as we modernized the legacy system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When Culture Trumps Everything</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2015/06/15/when-culture-trumps-everything/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had an interesting experience recently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had a job opportunity dropped in my lap. A greenfield project that had a pay range $10-40k more than what I&amp;rsquo;m currently making.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You have my attention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I responded to the recruiter and within a few days, I had an initial meeting/interview with one of the higher-ups at the company.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I went and had a nice conversation with him. He was a cool person, not much older than myself. The company itself was pretty cool, and looked and acted very much like a Silicon Valley startup. We even sat in a conference room that had a feminism-themed mural on one wall (I was told that each of the conference rooms had mural of different themes, though the other rooms were occupied at the time, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to see much of them). The primary working space sported a handful of colorful market umbrellas (which I later found out served the purpose of shielding some of the employees from the direct sunlight that streamed in from the skylights overhead) interspersed through the three columns of desks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, I got an invitation to an Amazon recruiting event:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p&gt;Hi Shauna-&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p&gt;I came across your information in our system and your background is impressive!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I posted my &lt;a href=&#34;http://shaunagordon.com/2014/10/15/dear-recruiters/&#34;&gt;open letter to recruiters&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a number of people speaking out against it (&amp;ldquo;against&amp;rdquo; used loosely here, ranging from &amp;ldquo;employees &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to be in the office&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the best companies hire the best people and the best people &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to go into the office&amp;rdquo; (that&amp;rsquo;s not insulting &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;) to &amp;ldquo;working remotely is isolating&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;in-person communication is better&amp;rdquo;). I decided to address a few of these things head-on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An Open Letter To Recruiters</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2014/10/15/dear-recruiters/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Third Party Recruiters,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Due to the high volume of contact requests I’ve received, I have decided to write this open letter in order to improve the quality of my network.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Greater Columbus Area is home to a very large number of third party recruiting companies. This means &lt;strong&gt;you have a lot of competition&lt;/strong&gt;. Competition should mean improved quality. Unfortunately, what I generally see is rather disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We tech folks are generally a merit-based people. We’ll respect you if we have reason to do so. You can earn that respect by demonstrating that you respect us and what we do (and no, saying that you do doesn’t cut it; show, don’t tell). Here are some ways to do that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been torn over how open I should be with this, particularly in my professional life. My first instinct has been for it to be on a very need to know basis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I met &lt;a href=&#34;http://baugues.com/&#34;&gt;Greg Baugues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Greg is a developer evangelist (devangelist) for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twilio.com/&#34;&gt;Twilio&lt;/a&gt;, who speaks at conferences about his ADHD and Type II Bipolar, and he gets well-deserved standing ovations pretty much wherever he speaks. I still fight tearing up just thinking about &lt;a href=&#34;http://userscape.com/laracon/2014/gregbaugues.html&#34;&gt;the talk I attended at Laracon&lt;/a&gt;, back in mid-May, where he even took his Bipolar medication on stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There&#39;s no way you&#39;ll get to the office by 9, you still have 10 miles to go. When you finally do arrive at 9:15, you try to sneak to your desk unnoticed, but your boss is already there. &#34;So nice of you to join us this morning,&#34; he greets you, a &#34;do it again and you&#39;re fired&#34; look on his face. You sit down at your desk, still a little too agitated to start work quite yet, so you read your favorite news site for ten minutes. Part of you resigns to this life, believing it&#39;s the way things are, and nothing will change, but another part of you feels that there must be a better way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

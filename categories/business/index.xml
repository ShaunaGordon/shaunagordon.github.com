      <description>So I happened to notice the other day that my site gets a lot more traffic than I realized (thanks, PointHQ!), so I tossed a little, lightweight analytics thing onto it so I can see where people are going and maybe we&amp;rsquo;re they&amp;rsquo;re coming from. (Hi, people! üëã)
One of the things I noticed was that an old, old blog post of mine was getting hit. Like&amp;hellip;so old that I didn&amp;rsquo;t migrate it originally, considering it defunct and no longer applicable.</description>

      <description>Among my many blog post drafts, I have a satirical piece that was originally intended to turn all the &amp;ldquo;remote working is inferior [because it&amp;rsquo;s a new thing with a learning curve]&amp;rdquo; stuff on its head.
&amp;hellip;And then COVID-19 happened and pretty much overnight, just about everyone suddenly had to do at least some things remotely (even if work wasn&amp;rsquo;t one of them).
Schools are all now done in distance learning format (hat-tip to all of the school staff who busted their tails to make that pivot and get students of all ages going with relatively little disruption!</description>

      <description>Some Notes:
Contrary to most of my other posts, I plan to update this one periodically as things change and this is still current. Check back periodically for updates.
Are you a business owner or manager? Have a look at Remotewave.io&amp;rsquo;s guide, which approaches it from your side. :)
 Well&amp;hellip;now that half the world is in quarantine of some level, a great many people are suddenly finding themselves tossed head first in the deep end of remote working.</description>

      <title>A Week Of Shipt</title>

      <description>Hey-o! This is a really old post and no longer reflects what I do. I ended up going back to software development in October of that year. It was a nice break, but unfortunately, 2016 was also the year gig economy jobs as a whole kind of took a dump. This is here for posterity, though, to avoid broken links. Be sure to read the update
Yes, this is basically what I do, minus the mess.</description>

      <title>Finding One&#39;s Strengths</title>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s This Strengths Finding Thing? I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of podcasts lately. I&amp;rsquo;m particularly a fan of Smart Passive Income and Screw The Nine To Five. They&amp;rsquo;re both great podcasts for learning about how to build your own business in order to generate income that&amp;rsquo;s not dependent on trading your time for money. They&amp;rsquo;re a gold mine of various resources, not just for starting and running one&amp;rsquo;s own business, but for business and life stuff in general.</description>

      <title>From Developer to Shipt Shopper</title>

      <description>Wait&amp;hellip;what? I traded a lucrative programming career for&amp;hellip;buying and delivering groceries?
In short, yes. For now, at least.
Simply Put &amp;ndash; I Got Burned The F&amp;ndash; Out I left my development job just before Thanksgiving. I all but literally told them &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not you, it&amp;rsquo;s me,&amp;rdquo; because that was the truth. I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything but good stuff to say about the company I worked for, because they were about as close to perfect as I&amp;rsquo;ve found.</description>

      <title>When Culture Trumps Everything</title>

      <description>I had an interesting experience recently.
I had a job opportunity dropped in my lap. A greenfield project that had a pay range $10-40k more than what I&amp;rsquo;m currently making.
You have my attention.
I responded to the recruiter and within a few days, I had an initial meeting/interview with one of the higher-ups at the company.
I went and had a nice conversation with him. He was a cool person, not much older than myself.</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago, I got an invitation to an Amazon recruiting event:
 Hi Shauna-

We are currently looking to hire Sr. Software Development Engineers (SDEs) to join the Amazon Retail team and are hosting an ‚ÄúInvitation Only‚Äù recruiting event for the Amazon Media and International Expansion (ISE) organizations specifically the week of February 16th.</description>

      <description>Since I posted my open letter to recruiters, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a number of people speaking out against it (&amp;ldquo;against&amp;rdquo; used loosely here, ranging from &amp;ldquo;employees need to be in the office&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the best companies hire the best people and the best people want to go into the office&amp;rdquo; (that&amp;rsquo;s not insulting at all) to &amp;ldquo;working remotely is isolating&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;in-person communication is better&amp;rdquo;). I decided to address a few of these things head-on.</description>

      <title>An Open Letter To Recruiters</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2014/10/15/dear-recruiters/</link>

      <description>Dear Third Party Recruiters,
Due to the high volume of contact requests I‚Äôve received, I have decided to write this open letter in order to improve the quality of my network.
The Greater Columbus Area is home to a very large number of third party recruiting companies. This means you have a lot of competition. Competition should mean improved quality. Unfortunately, what I generally see is rather disappointing.
We tech folks are generally a merit-based people.</description>

      <title>You&#39;re Not Alone</title>

      <description>I‚Äôve been torn over how open I should be with this, particularly in my professional life. My first instinct has been for it to be on a very need to know basis.
Then I met Greg Baugues.
Greg is a developer evangelist (devangelist) for Twilio, who speaks at conferences about his ADHD and Type II Bipolar, and he gets well-deserved standing ovations pretty much wherever he speaks. I still fight tearing up just thinking about the talk I attended at Laracon, back in mid-May, where he even took his Bipolar medication on stage.</description>

      <description>Why Work Sucks and How to Fix It: No Schedules, No Meetings, No Joke--the Simple Change That Can Make Your Job TerrificYou anxiously look at your watch as the traffic creeps forward - 8:55am. There&#39;s no way you&#39;ll get to the office by 9, you still have 10 miles to go. When you finally do arrive at 9:15, you try to sneak to your desk unnoticed, but your boss is already there.</description>

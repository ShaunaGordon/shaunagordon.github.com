      <description>Hey-o! This is a really old post and no longer reflects what I do. I ended up going back to software development in October of that year. It was a nice break, but unfortunately, 2016 was also the year gig economy jobs as a whole kind of took a dump. This is here for posterity, though, to avoid broken links. Be sure to read the update
Yes, this is basically what I do, minus the mess.</description>

      <description>Hey-o! There have been some changes made to this process. Be sure to check out the updates.
This is actually the second time I&amp;rsquo;ve leveraged Travis CI for managing my static-site blog, but apparently I didn&amp;rsquo;t write about it. I had done it shortly after setting up the Octopress version of my blog. It was nice and convenient, and dramatically lowered the barrier to writing more blog entries, though I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that until I lost that capability when I switched to Pelican (probably because the Octopress version was a bit finicky, due to breaking changes in the upstream Octopress repo, so the barrier was still pretty high).</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s This Strengths Finding Thing? I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of podcasts lately. I&amp;rsquo;m particularly a fan of Smart Passive Income and Screw The Nine To Five. They&amp;rsquo;re both great podcasts for learning about how to build your own business in order to generate income that&amp;rsquo;s not dependent on trading your time for money. They&amp;rsquo;re a gold mine of various resources, not just for starting and running one&amp;rsquo;s own business, but for business and life stuff in general.</description>

In short, yes. For now, at least.
Simply Put &amp;ndash; I Got Burned The F&amp;ndash; Out I left my development job just before Thanksgiving. I all but literally told them &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not you, it&amp;rsquo;s me,&amp;rdquo; because that was the truth. I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything but good stuff to say about the company I worked for, because they were about as close to perfect as I&amp;rsquo;ve found.</description>

      <description>I had an interesting experience recently.
I had a job opportunity dropped in my lap. A greenfield project that had a pay range $10-40k more than what I&amp;rsquo;m currently making.
You have my attention.
I responded to the recruiter and within a few days, I had an initial meeting/interview with one of the higher-ups at the company.
I went and had a nice conversation with him. He was a cool person, not much older than myself.</description>

      <description>When in the throes of a depressive episode (or on the edge of an anxiety attack or any other such motivation killer), it can be hard to maintain motivation and productivity. This can be detrimental when other people rely on you, or when you have a job to hold down.
Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve found a number of things that have helped keep me motivated through low times, and have decided to share them.</description>

      <description>I’ve been torn over how open I should be with this, particularly in my professional life. My first instinct has been for it to be on a very need to know basis.
Then I met Greg Baugues.
Greg is a developer evangelist (devangelist) for Twilio, who speaks at conferences about his ADHD and Type II Bipolar, and he gets well-deserved standing ovations pretty much wherever he speaks. I still fight tearing up just thinking about the talk I attended at Laracon, back in mid-May, where he even took his Bipolar medication on stage.</description>

      <description>Handcrafted CSS: More Bulletproof Web Design, Video Edition
While at one of my previous clients, a coworker ordered this book as a resource at the office. I was the first to read it and simply couldn&#39;t put it down. Handcrafted CSS: More Bulletproof Web Design highlights modern CSS techniques that help build robust, attractive, designs.
Unlike most technical books, which often provide too much tech and not enough explanation, or too much theory and not enough tech, this book provides a fantastic balance, and even uses a running case study that it builds and enhances as the reader progresses through the book.</description>

      <description>Why Work Sucks and How to Fix It: No Schedules, No Meetings, No Joke--the Simple Change That Can Make Your Job Terrific
You anxiously look at your watch as the traffic creeps forward - 8:55am. There&#39;s no way you&#39;ll get to the office by 9, you still have 10 miles to go. When you finally do arrive at 9:15, you try to sneak to your desk unnoticed, but your boss is already there.</description>

      <description>About Me I make stuff.
My profession is problem solving. My chosen tool by which to do that has been developing software. I&amp;rsquo;ve written shell scripts, maintained systems in .Net, built APIs in PHP, and implemented interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I&amp;rsquo;ve maintained legacy systems and built cutting-edge, life-changing applications, as well as created little tools to support other people in getting their work done.
Writing software isn&amp;rsquo;t all I do, though.</description>

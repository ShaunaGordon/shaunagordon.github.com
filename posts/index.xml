      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;about-me&#34;&gt;About Me&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My profession is problem solving. My chosen tool by which to do that has been developing software. I&amp;rsquo;ve written shell scripts, maintained systems in .Net, built APIs in PHP, and implemented interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I&amp;rsquo;ve maintained legacy systems and built cutting-edge, life-changing applications, as well as created little tools to support other people in getting their work done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing software isn&amp;rsquo;t all I do, though. I like to write English words, too, and my writing is about as eclectic as my coding. While my blog started (ages ago) as a &amp;ldquo;tech and work blog,&amp;rdquo; it soon expanded out to other aspects of life, including personal finance and the broader culture. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll spin some topics off to their own blogs, eventually.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;(Ways I Make Money From This Site)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-hate-ads&#34;&gt;I &lt;em&gt;Hate&lt;/em&gt; Ads&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do, with a passion. The first extension I install on any browser is AdBlock. That&amp;rsquo;s how much I hate them. I also hate when blogs write a &amp;ldquo;review&amp;rdquo; or other article for the sole purpose of selling that product. You know the kind I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. They read like a commercial and are full of keywords and buzzwords about the product. I can usually spot them a mile away and they annoy the crap out of me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;hiring-me&#34;&gt;Hiring Me&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking to work with me? Cool! Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the type of relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-type&#34;&gt;What Type?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conventional-employment&#34;&gt;Conventional Employment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you read through that &amp;#x261d;&amp;#xfe0f; and still want to hire me as a conventional employee? Well&amp;hellip;it didn&amp;rsquo;t scare you away, so that&amp;rsquo;s a start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my sake and yours, I have a high bar for conventional employment in particular. Let&amp;rsquo;s put it this way: I&amp;rsquo;ve turned down Amazon roughly half a dozen times at this point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Week Of Shipt</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hey-o! This is a really old post and no longer reflects what I do. I ended up going back to software development in October of that year. It was a nice break, but unfortunately, 2016 was also the year gig economy jobs as a whole kind of took a dump. This is here for posterity, though, to avoid broken links. Be sure to &lt;a href=&#34;http://shaunagordon.com/2021/02/10/a-look-back-at-shipt&#34;&gt;read the update&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hey-o! There have been some changes made to this process. &lt;a href=&#34;http://shaunagordon.com/2017/09/01/pelican-travis-and-github&#34;&gt;Be sure to check out the updates.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually the second time I&amp;rsquo;ve leveraged &lt;a href=&#34;https://travis-ci.org/&#34;&gt;Travis CI&lt;/a&gt; for managing my static-site blog, but apparently I didn&amp;rsquo;t write about it. I had done it shortly after setting up the Octopress version of my blog. It was nice and convenient, and dramatically lowered the barrier to writing more blog entries, though I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that until I lost that capability when I switched to Pelican (probably because the Octopress version was a bit finicky, due to breaking changes in the upstream Octopress repo, so the barrier was still pretty high).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of podcasts lately. I&amp;rsquo;m particularly a fan of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/&#34;&gt;Smart Passive Income&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://screwtheninetofive.com/&#34;&gt;Screw The Nine To Five&lt;/a&gt;. They&amp;rsquo;re both great podcasts for learning about how to build your own business in order to generate income that&amp;rsquo;s not dependent on trading your time for money. They&amp;rsquo;re a gold mine of various resources, not just for starting and running one&amp;rsquo;s own business, but for business and life stuff in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From Developer to Shipt Shopper</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2016/01/06/from-developer-to-shipt-shopper/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wait&amp;hellip;what? I traded a lucrative programming career for&amp;hellip;buying and delivering groceries?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, yes. For now, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;simply-put----i-got-burned-the-f---out&#34;&gt;Simply Put &amp;ndash; I Got Burned The F&amp;ndash; Out&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left my development job just before Thanksgiving. I all but literally told them &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not you, it&amp;rsquo;s me,&amp;rdquo; because that was the truth. I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything but good stuff to say about the company I worked for, because they were about as close to perfect as I&amp;rsquo;ve found. They really didn&amp;rsquo;t care about the number of hours you worked, as long as you got the work done. They care about their employees (I went to the upper management a couple of times with some issues, and not only did they &lt;em&gt;listen&lt;/em&gt; to what I had to say, they took it seriously and made change in order to fix the underlying problem). They valued employees&amp;rsquo; time and acted accordingly (kept meetings and interruptions to a minimum, had an unlimited paid time off policy, etc). The code, itself, is what burnt me out, really, and even that, had I been able to stick it out, probably would have resolved over time, as we modernized the legacy system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had an interesting experience recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a job opportunity dropped in my lap. A greenfield project that had a pay range $10-40k more than what I&amp;rsquo;m currently making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I responded to the recruiter and within a few days, I had an initial meeting/interview with one of the higher-ups at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went and had a nice conversation with him. He was a cool person, not much older than myself. The company itself was pretty cool, and looked and acted very much like a Silicon Valley startup. We even sat in a conference room that had a feminism-themed mural on one wall (I was told that each of the conference rooms had mural of different themes, though the other rooms were occupied at the time, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to see much of them). The primary working space sported a handful of colorful market umbrellas (which I later found out served the purpose of shielding some of the employees from the direct sunlight that streamed in from the skylights overhead) interspersed through the three columns of desks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ways To Keep Going</title>
      <link>http://shaunagordon.com/2014/10/30/motivation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When in the throes of a depressive episode (or on the edge of an anxiety attack or any other such motivation killer), it can be hard to maintain motivation and productivity. This can be detrimental when other people rely on you, or when you have a job to hold down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve found a number of things that have helped keep me motivated through low times, and have decided to share them. Unlike other articles giving advice on &amp;ldquo;cheering up,&amp;rdquo; the items here may or may not actually lift your mood. That&amp;rsquo;s not the point of them, and anyone who&amp;rsquo;s dealt with depression will tell you that most of the time, things designed to &amp;ldquo;cheer you up&amp;rdquo; don&amp;rsquo;t really work. If it does lift your mood, then that&amp;rsquo;s a positive side effect, but as Winston Churchill put it, &amp;ldquo;when you&amp;rsquo;re going through hell, keep going.&amp;rdquo; These items are intended to do &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; help you keep going.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been torn over how open I should be with this, particularly in my professional life. My first instinct has been for it to be on a very need to know basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I met &lt;a href=&#34;http://baugues.com/&#34;&gt;Greg Baugues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg is a developer evangelist (devangelist) for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twilio.com/&#34;&gt;Twilio&lt;/a&gt;, who speaks at conferences about his ADHD and Type II Bipolar, and he gets well-deserved standing ovations pretty much wherever he speaks. I still fight tearing up just thinking about &lt;a href=&#34;http://userscape.com/laracon/2014/gregbaugues.html&#34;&gt;the talk I attended at Laracon&lt;/a&gt;, back in mid-May, where he even took his Bipolar medication on stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I was the first to read it and simply couldn&#39;t put it down. &lt;em&gt;Handcrafted CSS: More Bulletproof Web Design&lt;/em&gt; highlights modern CSS techniques that help build robust, attractive, designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike most technical books, which often provide too much tech and not enough explanation, or too much theory and not enough tech, this book provides a fantastic balance, and even uses a running case study that it builds and enhances as the reader progresses through the book. Not only are readers able to understand the concepts the book presents, but they also learn ways to put the new concepts into practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There&#39;s no way you&#39;ll get to the office by 9, you still have 10 miles to go. When you finally do arrive at 9:15, you try to sneak to your desk unnoticed, but your boss is already there. &#34;So nice of you to join us this morning,&#34; he greets you, a &#34;do it again and you&#39;re fired&#34; look on his face. You sit down at your desk, still a little too agitated to start work quite yet, so you read your favorite news site for ten minutes. Part of you resigns to this life, believing it&#39;s the way things are, and nothing will change, but another part of you feels that there must be a better way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

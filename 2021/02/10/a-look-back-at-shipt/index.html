				<article class="post-content twemoji">
					<p>So I happened to notice the other day that my site gets a <em>lot</em> more traffic than I realized (thanks, PointHQ!), so I tossed a little, lightweight analytics thing onto it so I can see where people are going and maybe we&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re coming from. (Hi, people! &#x1f44b;)</p>
<p>One of the things I noticed was that <a href="/2016/01/13/a-week-of-shipt">an old, <em>old</em> blog post</a> of mine was getting hit. Like&hellip;so old that I didn&rsquo;t migrate it originally, considering it defunct and no longer applicable.</p>
<p>Apparently, I was wrong.</p>
<p>And people are still interested in it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve resurrected it (this is why I kept a backup of my old blog &#x1f609;), but I also found myself wanting to make a bunch of notes on it. Since I try to avoid doing that as much as possible, I figured I&rsquo;d write an update to it.</p>
<h2 id="all-good-things-must-end">All Good Things Must End&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#all-good-things-must-end"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>I ended up doing the Shipt thing only until about October. I had wanted to try to keep doing it after I started working full time again, but that just didn&rsquo;t happen. It didn&rsquo;t help that by that time, they had made changes such that it became infeasible for me to do so, given the nature of the Central Ohio market. (The work essentially dried up for the times I was available.)</p>
<p>It was fun while it lasted, though, and I do miss a couple of the repeat customers I had. That time, especially during the earlier months, showed how such a service <em>could</em> have been, I think.</p>
<h2 id="the-grocery-store-sector-is-weird">The Grocery Store Sector Is Weird&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#the-grocery-store-sector-is-weird"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>The competition in the grocery sector is <em>weird</em>. I never would have thought that grocery stores would get all up in arms about third parties that literally come in and pay retail price with a value-add model.</p>
<p>By the time I quit doing it, Shipt was about to head into the <em>third</em> chain here &ndash; Meijer. When Shipt originally came here, they had been going to Giant Eagle. That lasted all of about a week before Giant Eagle kicked them out (apparently it was pretty hostile, too). Kroger was cool with it for a little while, but soon got weird about it as they started preparing to launch their own curbside thing (from the looks of Shipt&rsquo;s marketing, that relationship seems to have improved; Covid probably helped show that there was plenty of room for everyone).</p>
<p>Target clearly loved the idea enough to straight-up buy them, which kind of makes Shipt&rsquo;s ability to shop at a bunch of the other stores even more weird. You&rsquo;d think that if they only begrudgingly accept an independent third party throwing money at them, they&rsquo;d <em>hate</em> a comptitor doing it and basically getting extra money on top. And yet, there are now more store options in a given area than ever.</p>
<h2 id="the-gig-economy-goes-to-pot">The Gig Economy Goes To Pot&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#the-gig-economy-goes-to-pot"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>Circa 2017 is when the rose colored glasses about the gig or &ldquo;platform&rdquo; economy as a whole had fallen apart to the point irreparability. The time I stopped working for Shipt is about the same time Uber started getting beat over the head by the regulation and legal bat for worker misclassification, wage theft, and other issues. Other gig platforms flew under the radar, but from what I saw, they were doing not-dissimilar things, albeit in more subtle ways.</p>
<p>Shipt was no different, unfortunately. They started with &ldquo;metrics&rdquo; that were ostensibly &ldquo;guides&rdquo; for the shoppers. Things like pass rate (how many available orders a shopper passes on), rating based on whether the delivery was logged late (there was something like this when I started, but it became more extensive as time went on), overall rating minimums (the damage from &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t do 5 stars because no one&rsquo;s perfect&rdquo; customers be damned; and I&rsquo;d <em>hate</em> to have been a shopper this past March and April), and a few others I&rsquo;ve since forgotten. The initial claim was that they wouldn&rsquo;t affect anything.</p>
<p>That claim is <em>never</em> true. Ever.</p>
<p>As soon as something starts getting measured, it starts being used for judgement, for better or worse.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t long before that was the case, and various other little changes started making it feel like they were dancing around the line between &ldquo;independent contractor&rdquo; and &ldquo;defacto employee,&rdquo; while still vehemently trying to sell the line that we really, truly, were independent.</p>
<p>Apparently, issues like that just got worse, up to and including a switch to <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/every-single-person-is-losing-money-shipt-is-the-latest-gig-platform-to-screw-its-workers/ar-BBZVF0k">a more opaque payment structure that many say resulted in a pay reduction</a>, and even <a href="https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Shipt/reviews/takes-a-very-specific-person-to-take-the-frustrations-this-job-heaps-on-you?id=22110626d8d3a90c">dropping people with essentially no notice and no info</a> (the reviews on Indeed are astoundingly scathing).</p>
<h2 id="the-tip-structure-sucked">The Tip Structure Sucked&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#the-tip-structure-sucked"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>In doing some digging for up to date information to see if/how things have changed, I&rsquo;ve seen fleeting mention that they&rsquo;ve attempted to encourage 10% tips, but I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s stuck (what I&rsquo;m finding more of, actually, are a number of issues that prevented shoppers from getting tips <em>at all,</em> at least on some orders).</p>
<p>When I was doing it, though, the tip options were fixed values that had no bearing on the size of the order. This meant that on more than one occasion, if I got a tip at all, it was $5&hellip;on a $100+ order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tipped the 5 Guys crew more than that. &#x1f611;</p>
<p>Now, to be fair, there were some <em>awesome</em> tippers, too. One customer would reliably tip something like $20 or $25, even though his orders were generally only about $50, he trusted the shopper to make substitutes, and wanted his order left on his porch.</p>
<p>That guy was by far one of my favorites and most memorable, and I&rsquo;ve never even seen his face.</p>
<p>However, $5 tips, regardless of order value, was the norm, in no small part because that&rsquo;s how the system was set up. Most designers will tell you that most people will invariably select the lowest tip value if presented with options. Let&rsquo;s just say that getting $5 for a $150 order for picky upper-middle-class soccer moms got old (seriously, I swear there&rsquo;s an inverse correlation between affluency and relative tip amount; were it not for the couple of customers I liked who happened to be in the higher-end zones, I&rsquo;d have dropped the affluent zones altogether in favor of the less affluent ones, because those customers were so much more enjoyable and rewarding to shop for).</p>
<h2 id="shopper-customer-ratio-issues">Shopper-Customer Ratio Issues&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#shopper-customer-ratio-issues"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>One thing they never did seem to get right is the balance of shoppers to customers, especially in the smaller markets. The result was a sort of &ldquo;feast-famine&rdquo; cycle, where there&rsquo;d be high competition for a short supply of orders, or a slew of orders that go to &ldquo;promo,&rdquo; because they weren&rsquo;t getting picked up.</p>
<p>Now, to be fair, this is a harder problem to solve than one might expect, because humans. However, you&rsquo;d think after four years of launching in a bunch of cities, they&rsquo;d have it figured out at least a little better, but apparently that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<h2 id="lack-of-order-stacking">Lack of Order Stacking&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#lack-of-order-stacking"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s grown since I left, but the Columbus market was quite small while I was working there. Between the sheer lack of orders, the distance between stores within even a given range, and the aforementioned Shopper-Customer ratio issues, being able to double up on orders was exceedingly rare. I think in 8 or so months I was doing it, I had maybe 3 or 4 opportunities to double up, and of them, <em>maybe one</em> wasn&rsquo;t really forced. The rest, I had pushed them kind of to their limit and in fact on at least one, I ended up a couple minutes late, because the two locations were basically on the opposite ends of their respective areas and about as far away from one another as they could possibly get while still being in adjacent zones.</p>
<p>That lack of opportunity to stack orders meant lack of opportunity to get more than the $8-9/hr average that I had calculated initially, making it increasingly not worth it (and <em>really</em> not worth it now, if the criticisms of the new algorithm are accurate and company-wide). That order stacking is what makes the whole system worthwhile at the line level. Without that, it&rsquo;s pretty much dead in the water.</p>
<h2 id="the-memory-lane-cul-de-sac">The Memory Lane Cul-de-Sac&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#the-memory-lane-cul-de-sac"><i class="small linkify icon"></i></a> </h2>
<p>At this point, I don&rsquo;t really have much more to say. It was fun while it lasted, and I genuinely did enjoy the experience. It was also valuable to me for helping me get back to my roots for working, more generally. I found what had slowly disappeared over the years in my job &ndash; that ability to make someone&rsquo;s day and get paid doing it &ndash; and how much I <em>missed</em> that.</p>
<p>I also am genuinely saddened by the trajectory I&rsquo;ve seen the company take in more recent years. They could have grown into something that really stood out from the competition in an increasingly crowded market, and instead, they&rsquo;ve largely chosen the same underhanded techniques the others have, and because of that, I can&rsquo;t really recommend them anymore. &#x1f61e;</p>

					<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>I make stuff.</p>
<p>My profession is problem solving. My chosen tool by which to do that has been developing software. I&rsquo;ve written shell scripts, maintained systems in .Net, built APIs in PHP, and implemented interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I&rsquo;ve maintained legacy systems and built cutting-edge, life-changing applications, as well as created little tools to support other people in getting their work done.</p>
<p>Writing software isn&rsquo;t all I do, though. I like to write English words, too, and my writing is about as eclectic as my coding. While my blog started (ages ago) as a &ldquo;tech and work blog,&rdquo; it soon expanded out to other aspects of life, including personal finance and the broader culture. Maybe I&rsquo;ll spin some topics off to their own blogs, eventually.</p>
<p>Professionally, I&rsquo;ve been a software developer for over a decade, with particular focus in full stack, PHP-based (and more recently, Python-based) web development. I&rsquo;ve also picked up professional teaching over the past year or so. For more details about my experience, <a href="http://resume.shaunagordon.com/">visit my resume</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, I&rsquo;ve embraced what seems to be my fate as an independent consultant and I run my own software development shop, World Tree Limited, through which I provide various development services and plan to release my own software products.</p>
<p>Culture means a great deal to me, so it should come as no surprise that I hold it above all else when working with organizations and I have a fair number of words to say about the current broader culture here in the US, and they go hand-in-hand. I&rsquo;m a staunch advocate of equitable culture, both inside and outside the (proverbial or literal) office, and I&rsquo;m not afraid to lose &ldquo;opportunities&rdquo; (though I&rsquo;d argue such things are not my kind of opportunities) because of it.</p>
<p>Maybe that makes me <a href="https://unemployable.com/podcast/intro/">&ldquo;unemployable&rdquo;</a>?</p>
<p>Or perhaps it&rsquo;s a criticism of conventional workplaces and I&rsquo;ve just been <a href="https://www.gorowe.com/">ahead of the curve</a>?</p>
<p>&#x1f937;&zwj;&#x2640;&#xfe0f;</p>
<p>Regardless, it gives my mind the never-ending puzzle of finding better ways of supporting my family.</p>

<p>(Ways I Make Money From This Site)</p>
<h2 id="i-hate-ads">I <em>Hate</em> Ads&hellip;</h2>
<p>I do, with a passion. The first extension I install on any browser is AdBlock. That&rsquo;s how much I hate them. I also hate when blogs write a &ldquo;review&rdquo; or other article for the sole purpose of selling that product. You know the kind I&rsquo;m talking about. They read like a commercial and are full of keywords and buzzwords about the product. I can usually spot them a mile away and they annoy the crap out of me.</p>
<h2 id="and-paywalls">&hellip;And Paywalls&hellip;</h2>
<p>I also hate when content is stuck behind a paywall for no good reason. The primary purpose of my blog is to share my knowledge with my audience. While I have no problem with the &ldquo;freemium&rdquo; (or even just premium) model for applications, I&rsquo;m not keen on them for article-based sites &ndash; at least not for mine. I think information is best shared freely, especially when it comes to some of the topics I cover.</p>
<h2 id="but-running-blogs-cost-resources">&hellip;But Running Blogs Cost Resources</h2>
<p>It does, however, take time, money, brainpower, equipment, etc. (ie - resources) to write my posts and maintain this and my other sites. The holy grail of arguably any hobby is for it to pay for itself. Now, obviously, brainpower (mental energy) isn&rsquo;t a currency society can deal in (how cool would that be, though? And I&rsquo;m still waiting for the tech that would allow me to just download my stream of consciousness to my computer), but hosting and keeping my domain name do require monetary resources. As a result, I offer (and may, in the future offer more) various ways to help defray these costs.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-make-money">How I Make Money</h2>
<p>Since I don&rsquo;t do ads, and I don&rsquo;t do paywalls, I need to implement other avenues from which to bring in money. Those methods are detailed below.</p>
<p>All methods are completely optional and you are under no obligation to use any of them or give me anything. The hope, though, is that the content of my site (or maybe some other interaction you&rsquo;ve had with me) has provided you with such value that you <em>want</em> to give back somehow, and in those situations, I want to make it easy for you to do so.</p>
<p>Oh, and <strong>10% of my income goes to a charity or project each month.</strong> More about that later.</p>
<h3 id="donations">Donations</h3>
<p>An easy way to give back is simply giving money. You&rsquo;re free to donate whatever amount you wish. You can do that via <a href="https://ko-fi.com/shaunagordon">my Ko-fi page</a> for one-time payments, or via <a href="https://liberapay.com/Dreamwalker-Collective/">my Liberapay</a> page for recurring payments.</p>
<h3 id="affiliate-program">Affiliate Program</h3>
<p>Another way to give back is to purchase things through my affiliate program. If I have something available that you are looking to buy, simply buy it through me, and I get a cut of the purchase at no extra cost to you.</p>
<p>This differs from ads in that the items and brands available via the affiliate program are ones that I&rsquo;ve used myself and would recommend. Additionally, they will only be linked to when I&rsquo;m actually talking about them. I figure that if I&rsquo;m going to review things and recommend them to my audience, anyway, I might as well provide them via an affiliate program.</p>
<h3 id="selling-my-own-things-directly">Selling My Own Things, Directly</h3>
<p>I sell some of my own things, as well, since I have a couple other hobbies. The funds from those things help pay for my sites, as well (as well as meatspace supplies as needed).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://leanpub.com/u/ShaunaGordon">Leanpub</a></li>
<li><a href="http://worldtreefarms.com">Soap Store</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(And Indirectly)</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also a gamer and like to tinker with <em>World of Warcraft</em> addons, in particular, but I technically can&rsquo;t make money from them directly (ie - I can&rsquo;t sell them), hence the name on the Liberapay account. <a href="https://dreamwalker-collective.github.io/">You can find those projects here.</a></p>
<h2 id="giving-back">Giving Back</h2>
<p>As I mentioned previously, <strong>10% of my income is donated each month.</strong> This is 10% off the top of my after-tax income, before other expenses.</p>
<p>To whom I choose to donate in a given month is somewhat random (it&rsquo;s who I decide to donate to that month), and whether it&rsquo;s an official non-profit organization isn&rsquo;t of particular concern, because I&rsquo;m not doing it for the tax write-off. Instead, I do it for the sake of giving back. I work with a lot of open source software, and am part of a number of communities that would benefit from a little financial backing. So, I do what I can to show my thanks and help support them.</p>
<p>What projects/organizations do I donate to? Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)</li>
<li>Apache Foundation</li>
<li>Ansible</li>
<li>Vagrant</li>
<li>American Foundation for Suicide Prevention</li>
<li>Trevor Project</li>
<li>Autism Self Advocacy Network</li>
<li>GoFundMe campaigns (usually for someone facing a hardship)</li>
<li>PCOS Foundation</li>
<li>Do Yoga With Me</li>
<li>Kickstarter projects, including:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1035100786/truenorth-php-woolly-mammoth-plush-toy">True North PHP</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1593368264/blessed-designs-ethically-made-t-shirts">Blessed Designs</a>, a trio of women of color starting a sustainably- and ethically-made (and comfy!) clothing company</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>&hellip;and many others</li>
</ul>

                    <h1 id="hiring-me">Hiring Me</h1>
<p>Looking to work with me? Cool! Let&rsquo;s start with the type of relationship.</p>
<h2 id="what-type">What Type?</h2>
<h3 id="conventional-employment">Conventional Employment</h3>
<p>So you read through that &#x261d;&#xfe0f; and still want to hire me as a conventional employee? Well&hellip;it didn&rsquo;t scare you away, so that&rsquo;s a start.</p>
<p>For my sake and yours, I have a high bar for conventional employment in particular. Let&rsquo;s put it this way: I&rsquo;ve turned down Amazon roughly half a dozen times at this point.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;ll want to start by reading the posts in <a href="/tags/culture/">the &ldquo;culture&rdquo; tag</a>. Ideally, you&rsquo;ll want to read most of my blog, though the <a href="/categories/business/">business category</a> might be most relevant to you (ostensibly a recruiter or businessperson of some sort).</p>
<p>I also expect to get paid what I&rsquo;m worth. Don&rsquo;t bother sending me leads unless the base compensation is six figures.</p>
<p>Oh, and location-independent. I&rsquo;m not interested in relocating (so please don&rsquo;t ask), and while I don&rsquo;t mind going into the office periodically (after this whole Covid thing gets worked out; and what &ldquo;periodically&rdquo; means will depend on where &ldquo;the office&rdquo; is), I do best working where I&rsquo;m most productive.</p>
<p>I also have this snazzy office of my own, and I&rsquo;d hate for it to go to waste. &#x1f609;</p>
<h3 id="independent-consulting">Independent Consulting</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got some work that needs done, but don&rsquo;t need a full time employee for it? Awesome! Let&rsquo;s see if we&rsquo;re a fit!</p>
<p>First of all, let me make it clear: <strong>I run a business,</strong> I am <em>not</em> a &ldquo;contractor,&rdquo; especially when that means &ldquo;employee in all but name&rdquo; (aka &ldquo;defacto employee,&rdquo; which is questionably legal, by the way). The relationship is a business-to-business one. I may be one person, but the arrangement is like that of an agency. I control my time, location, and equipment (though I am flexible on where code lives for compliance purposes and whatnot, and of course meetings are part of the relationship).</p>
<p>Still with me? Cool. Let&rsquo;s talk business.</p>
<p>Because I generally do large projects where scopes are subject to changing, I typically bill by the hour. The logistics are flexible, though, and I generally do one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase set number of hours &ndash; this is useful for knocking out a backlog or other shorter-term situation</li>
<li>A time-boxed contract without set hours &ndash; this is typically the best for large projects where either I supply the team or I&rsquo;m embedded in your team</li>
</ul>
<p>Both contracts are renewable/extendable (subject to availability), because expectations inevitably change over time, and pricing is determined by the services required and the nature of the relationship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also open to the &ldquo;purchase hours&rdquo; part on a retainer basis.</p>
<h2 id="still-works-for-you-lets-talk">Still Works For You? Let&rsquo;s Talk</h2>
<p>The best way to get in touch is via one of the communication options at the top of the page.</p>
<p>To save us both time, please be sure to include the important information about the work you need &ndash; things like tech stack, scope of work, and timeline requirements are super helpful in gauging whether we&rsquo;ll be a technical fit.</p>
<p>For conventional employement, please include pay range and benefit information.</p>
<p>In all cases, down-in-the-weeds details aren&rsquo;t required, just that 10,000-foot view will be sufficient to start.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you!</p>

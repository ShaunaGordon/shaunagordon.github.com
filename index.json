[{"categories":null,"contents":"About Me I make stuff.\nMy profession is problem solving. My chosen tool by which to do that has been developing software. I\u0026rsquo;ve written shell scripts, maintained systems in .Net, built APIs in PHP, and implemented interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I\u0026rsquo;ve maintained legacy systems and built cutting-edge, life-changing applications, as well as created little tools to support other people in getting their work done.\nWriting software isn\u0026rsquo;t all I do, though. I like to write English words, too, and my writing is about as eclectic as my coding. While my blog started (ages ago) as a \u0026ldquo;tech and work blog,\u0026rdquo; it soon expanded out to other aspects of life, including personal finance and the broader culture. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll spin some topics off to their own blogs, eventually.\nProfessionally, I\u0026rsquo;ve been a software developer for over a decade, with particular focus in full stack, PHP-based (and more recently, Python-based) web development. I\u0026rsquo;ve also picked up professional teaching over the past year or so. For more details about my experience, visit my resume.\nOver the past couple of years, I\u0026rsquo;ve embraced what seems to be my fate as an independent consultant and I run my own software development shop, World Tree Limited, through which I provide various development services and plan to release my own software products.\nCulture means a great deal to me, so it should come as no surprise that I hold it above all else when working with organizations and I have a fair number of words to say about the current broader culture here in the US, and they go hand-in-hand. I\u0026rsquo;m a staunch advocate of equitable culture, both inside and outside the (proverbial or literal) office, and I\u0026rsquo;m not afraid to lose \u0026ldquo;opportunities\u0026rdquo; (though I\u0026rsquo;d argue such things are not my kind of opportunities) because of it.\nMaybe that makes me \u0026ldquo;unemployable\u0026rdquo;?\nOr perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s a criticism of conventional workplaces and I\u0026rsquo;ve just been ahead of the curve?\n\u0026#x1f937;\u0026zwj;\u0026#x2640;\u0026#xfe0f;\nRegardless, it gives my mind the never-ending puzzle of finding better ways of supporting my family.\n","date":"Jan 1, 1","description":"","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/about/about/","series":null,"subtitle":null,"tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"contents":"Buy Me Coffee (Ways I Make Money From This Site)\nI Hate Ads\u0026hellip; I do, with a passion. The first extension I install on any browser is AdBlock. That\u0026rsquo;s how much I hate them. I also hate when blogs write a \u0026ldquo;review\u0026rdquo; or other article for the sole purpose of selling that product. You know the kind I\u0026rsquo;m talking about. They read like a commercial and are full of keywords and buzzwords about the product. I can usually spot them a mile away and they annoy the crap out of me.\n\u0026hellip;And Paywalls\u0026hellip; I also hate when content is stuck behind a paywall for no good reason. The primary purpose of my blog is to share my knowledge with my audience. While I have no problem with the \u0026ldquo;freemium\u0026rdquo; (or even just premium) model for applications, I\u0026rsquo;m not keen on them for article-based sites \u0026ndash; at least not for mine. I think information is best shared freely, especially when it comes to some of the topics I cover.\n\u0026hellip;But Running Blogs Cost Resources It does, however, take time, money, brainpower, equipment, etc. (ie - resources) to write my posts and maintain this and my other sites. The holy grail of arguably any hobby is for it to pay for itself. Now, obviously, brainpower (mental energy) isn\u0026rsquo;t a currency society can deal in (how cool would that be, though? And I\u0026rsquo;m still waiting for the tech that would allow me to just download my stream of consciousness to my computer), but hosting and keeping my domain name do require monetary resources. As a result, I offer (and may, in the future offer more) various ways to help defray these costs.\nHow I Make Money Since I don\u0026rsquo;t do ads, and I don\u0026rsquo;t do paywalls, I need to implement other avenues from which to bring in money. Those methods are detailed below.\nAll methods are completely optional and you are under no obligation to use any of them or give me anything. The hope, though, is that the content of my site (or maybe some other interaction you\u0026rsquo;ve had with me) has provided you with such value that you want to give back somehow, and in those situations, I want to make it easy for you to do so.\nOh, and 10% of my income goes to a charity or project each month. More about that later.\nDonations An easy way to give back is simply giving money. You\u0026rsquo;re free to donate whatever amount you wish. You can do that via my Ko-fi page for one-time payments, or via my Liberapay page for recurring payments.\nAlternatively, you can sponsor me through Github, either one-time or on a recurring basis.\nSelling My Own Things, Directly I sell some of my own things, as well, since I have a couple other hobbies. The funds from those things help pay for my sites, as well (as well as meatspace supplies as needed).\nLeanpub (And Indirectly)\nI\u0026rsquo;m also a gamer and like to tinker with World of Warcraft addons, in particular, but I technically can\u0026rsquo;t make money from them directly (ie - I can\u0026rsquo;t sell them), hence the name on the Liberapay account. You can find those projects here.\nGiving Back As I mentioned previously, 10% of my income is donated each month.\nTo whom I choose to donate in a given month is somewhat random (it\u0026rsquo;s who I decide to donate to that month), and whether it\u0026rsquo;s an official non-profit organization isn\u0026rsquo;t of particular concern, because I\u0026rsquo;m not doing it for the tax write-off. Instead, I do it for the sake of giving back. I work with a lot of open source software, and am part of a number of communities that would benefit from a little financial backing. So, I do what I can to show my thanks and help support them.\nWhat projects/organizations do I donate to? Here are a few:\nGIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) Apache Foundation Ansible Vagrant American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Trevor Project SAGE Autism Self Advocacy Network GoFundMe campaigns (usually for someone facing a hardship) PCOS Foundation Do Yoga With Me Octoprint Kickstarter projects, including: True North PHP The community of Bula Batiki, Fiji, who are building sustainable income through the export of coconut oil Blessed Designs, a trio of women of color starting a sustainably- and ethically-made (and comfy!) clothing company Anka Cooperative, empowering Syrian refugees by employing and training them to make hand-woven rugs Radian Jeans, because pockets! \u0026hellip;and many others So, by helping me fund my projects, you\u0026rsquo;ll also be helping me fund many other projects. :)\n","date":"Jan 1, 1","description":"","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/about/buy-me-coffee/","series":null,"subtitle":null,"tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"contents":"Hiring Me Looking to work with me?

Well\u0026hellip;it didn\u0026rsquo;t scare you away, so that\u0026rsquo;s a start.\nFor my sake and yours, I have a high bar for conventional employment in particular.

The relationship is a business-to-business one. I may be one person, but the arrangement is like that of an agency. I control my time, location, and equipment (though I am flexible on where code lives for compliance purposes and whatnot, and of course meetings are part of the relationship).\nStill with me? Cool. Let\u0026rsquo;s talk business.\nBecause I generally do large projects where scopes are subject to changing, I typically bill by the hour. The logistics are flexible, though, and I generally do one of two ways:\nPurchase set number of hours \u0026ndash; this is useful for knocking out a backlog or other shorter-term situation A time-boxed contract without set hours \u0026ndash; this is typically the best for large projects where either I supply the team or I\u0026rsquo;m embedded in your team Both contracts are renewable/extendable (subject to availability), because expectations inevitably change over time, and pricing is determined by the services required and the nature of the relationship.\nI\u0026rsquo;m also open to the \u0026ldquo;purchase hours\u0026rdquo; part on a retainer basis.\nStill Works For You?

To which one replied with \u0026ldquo;allow me to introduce you to a friend of mine\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nA few conversations and several hours of game engine research later, and I\u0026rsquo;ve now become the principal engineer for an upstart game studio, and a contributor to a particular open source game engine called Open 3D Engine, or O3DE. We settled on it, thanks to Unity fucking with their pricing, and Unreal preparing to use their own engine-specific language for game programming, instead of the standard C++ they had been using (both of which were no-gos for us).\nAs an engineer, I was attracted to the modular nature of it. Everything is what they call a \u0026ldquo;Gem.\u0026rdquo; Each Gem is a particular feature, so the editor is a Gem, the rendering engine is a Gem, the physics engine is a Gem, the script graph, and so on and so forth. Combined with its open nature, it makes it perfect for the goal the studio has \u0026ndash; in addition to making games, also making a framework that makes it easier to make games.\nFor better or worse, the codebase is relatively mature, especially in comparison to the just couple of years it\u0026rsquo;s been out in the wild, thanks to it being the successor to Amazon\u0026rsquo;s Lumberyard, which itself was a fork of Cry Engine. (While the Cry Engine parts have been almost entirely replaced at this point, there are still numerous references to it in the source.) The whole thing is a Ship of Theseus that\u0026rsquo;s really quite fascinating to explore. That lineage also means that while it\u0026rsquo;s nowhere near the polish of Unreal or Unity (because a bunch of parts did get completely rebuilt), it\u0026rsquo;s actually got nearly all of the foundation we need, and the open source nature of it means anything it\u0026rsquo;s lacking, I can (at least theoretically) include or fix, or talk to other developers to advocate for it getting fixed by others.\nThe Deep Sea End I\u0026rsquo;m no stranger to jumping into the proverbial deep end in my career. I\u0026rsquo;ve changed industries \u0026ndash; going from ecommerce to health tech to insur-tech to logistics tech to academia and more \u0026ndash; as well as languages \u0026ndash; picking up most of the dozen or so programming languages (and more frameworks) on the fly. For the most part, my career has consisted of fundamentally the same kinds of problems to solve: taking data from one source, massaging it to fit a destination source, sending it to that destination, listening for responses, outputting it in some fashion. That makes the industry largely irrelevant, really, beyond providing the broader context for understanding the system, and I can focus on learning the tech if I need to, while the industry knowledge kind of comes along for the ride.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s\u0026hellip;not the case here. The industry matters here, because the software is\u0026hellip;kind of fundamentally different. There\u0026rsquo;s still a certain amount of \u0026ldquo;take input, do stuff, output,\u0026rdquo; but it takes understanding that input on a deeper level in order to even do that \u0026ndash; because you kind of have to know things like what the hell \u0026ldquo;frustum\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;lerp\u0026rdquo; are, or how field of view affects how a game feels (pro tip: if you\u0026rsquo;ve ever gotten sick from playing Darksiders 2, you\u0026rsquo;ve experienced this one), not to mention how these things actually translate into data and formats the computer understands. It\u0026rsquo;s math and cinematography and 3D modeling and programming. It\u0026rsquo;s really not just one industry, but like\u0026hellip;six.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s just take a swan dive into the Mariana Trench, shall we?\n(To be fair, this isn\u0026rsquo;t by any means unique to O3DE, though I get a bit more hands-on on stuff that I might not otherwise even have access to, because I\u0026rsquo;m doing a lot of work on the engine, itself.)\nSo\u0026hellip;How\u0026rsquo;s The Engine? Overall, I love it. Maybe my lack of experience with other engines leaves me naive to how things \u0026ldquo;could\u0026rdquo; be \u0026ndash; and certainly, I\u0026rsquo;ve run into its rough edges and shortfalls enough to see where it still needs work \u0026ndash; but I still enjoy working with, in, and on it. So let\u0026rsquo;s get into the specifics.\nGood: The Community Like all open source projects, O3DE lives or dies by its community. A lot of people are critical about its lineage of having been owned and open-sourced by Amazon after they sunsetted Lumberyard. While a fair concern, it\u0026rsquo;s largely unfounded, in my opinion. I\u0026rsquo;m by no means a fan of Amazon as a company, but they did this one right and gave it over to the Linux Foundation. This means that, while Amazon does pour a lot of resources into it, they don\u0026rsquo;t control it. If they were to halt all contributions tomorrow, O3DE could still live on and Amazon couldn\u0026rsquo;t suddenly change the license or fee structure and leave the community in the lurch.\nThe community members themselves, are also great. A lot of the core team worked on Lumberyard and the transition to O3DE, and then others from both big names \u0026ndash; including Red Hat, Meta, PopcornFX, and even Pixar(!!) \u0026ndash; and smaller shops and individuals have contributed and have a lot of great knowledge to share.\nGood: The Documentation There used to be a dedicated docs team, and it really shows. Docs are always a weak point for any project, regardless of licensing, so there\u0026rsquo;s always room for improvement, but the docs themselves can really get a newbie quite far, especially if they already have experience with other engines (my game developer had a bunch of \u0026ldquo;prototype\u0026rdquo; stuff going within about an hour).\nFor me, solid docs can make or break a complex application. So saying that I live in O3DE\u0026rsquo;s documentation is quite high praise, because it means I find it a useful and valuable resource.\nGood: The Modular Architecture Like I mentioned before, the modular architecture is what attracted me to O3DE to begin with. Everything is a Gem, even the core of the application and the rendering engine itself. This makes it very easy to swap out parts as needed (this doesn\u0026rsquo;t usually happen with core parts, of course, but it can happen with the extra things quite often).\nFrom an engineering standpoint, it also makes navigating the code super easy. Just find the Gem\u0026rsquo;s folder in the source and edit as needed. This has made it easy (and pretty safe, since coupling between Gems is very loose) to start making code contributions.\nThis modularity even extends to the various parts of the editor. While there aren\u0026rsquo;t really any alternative Gems for the editor right now, the possibility is there to build alternative editor UIs, add editor features, and more.\nHelp Wanted: Realtime Particle Effects This is a known issue. PopcornFX is officially available and O3DE is supported by them, but it is a paid solution, making for a bit of a barrier for newcomers and studios just getting started. Their licensing is quite generous, though, with a perpetual license after the first year, so it can still be an affordable option, if the potential user can swing it.\nIdeally, though, there should be an open source option for particle effects, which the project doesn\u0026rsquo;t yet have and has put out a call for anyone interested in taking it up.\nNeeds Improvement: User Experience Credit where it\u0026rsquo;s due \u0026ndash; game engine editors are complex as hell, so with that in mind, it\u0026rsquo;s quite solid, and when you\u0026rsquo;re using the parts with the most attention paid to user experience and usability, it\u0026rsquo;s quite easy to use.\nWhere it runs into trouble is particularly in the auxiliary tooling and self-recovery parts, forcing the user to go to the command line or edit config files in some instances. Now, these are pretty straightforward \u0026ndash; the commands are well-documented and not too complex, and the config files are simple JSON files \u0026ndash; but arguably, a regular user shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to resort to them to begin with. The Asset Processor could also use some UX love. Likewise, it\u0026rsquo;s not uncommon to see newer users run into friction points with the interface.\nImproving user experience is the Foundation\u0026rsquo;s main goal for 2024, though, so major improvements in this area can be expected over the course of this year.\nNeeds Improvement: Stability Again, complex system. Even more, a complex cross-platform system, written in the old-school cross-platform system of C++ and a Python/Qt UI. No Electron here, thank goodness, but it also means the maintainers are responsible for juggling stability across the board, which is a difficult thing to do. Dealing with graphics cards and the low-level things games and game engines tend to do with them also adds to the juggling act.\nAs a result, stability can be a little hit or miss. For some, it\u0026rsquo;s rock solid (and it\u0026rsquo;s certainly more stable on Windows and Ubuntu, the officially-supported operating systems). For others, it might crash on startup. My game developer seems to have a knack for finding all sorts of hidden crash triggers.\nConclusions If it\u0026rsquo;s not evident, I very much like O3DE. It has a lot of potential and has a lot of great people working on it. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely not for people who want a polished, super-easy-to-use engine yet, but for anyone with some patience and willing to do some trailblazing, it has a lot going for it. With all the work being done on it, I look forward to seeing where it goes in the future. I genuinely think it has the potential to become a solid contender with Unity and Unreal and be to the game engine arena what Blender is to 3D modeling.\n","date":"May 13, 2024","description":"First Impressions, Thoughts, and Diving Into The Deep End","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2024/05/13/open-3d-engine/","series":"Open 3D Engine","subtitle":null,"tags":["o3de","dev dive","gaming","game dev"],"title":"Open 3D Engine"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re a family here!\u0026rdquo;\nHow many times have you heard that from your boss? Or perhaps even the CEO of your company? I\u0026rsquo;ve heard it at nearly every company I\u0026rsquo;ve worked for. And I\u0026rsquo;ve worked for a lot.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s A Trap (I considered the Star Wars meme, but I like this one better.)\nWhat do you call a familial relationship in which one person controls another\u0026rsquo;s financial security in order to gain compliance?\nAt best, toxic, and dare I say, abusive.\nAnd yet, that\u0026rsquo;s exactly the dynamic at play in an employer-employee relationship. It\u0026rsquo;s really only a healthy relationship when both sides understand that it\u0026rsquo;s transactional and that the employee is a service provider and the employer is the client. When companies start using the family metaphor, it sets up a culture that can very easily slip into exploitation by fostering a sense of loyalty from employees that\u0026rsquo;s not reciprocated in this day and age.\nIn its worst incarnation, it\u0026rsquo;s used to exploit workers. People tend to go to lengths for their family that they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t go to for others, and are more easily convinced to do things for family. This makes it easy to guilt employees into working more hours, taking on more work, and not feeling like they can say no \u0026ndash; even to something unethical or even illegal.\nThe Familial Relationship Isn\u0026rsquo;t Conditional Or at least, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be. A family whose love is conditional is toxic, too.\nThe employer-employee relationship is inherently conditional \u0026ndash; you do the work I need you to do, to the standard I need you to do it, and I pay you an agreed-upon amount of money, let you use the insurance I was able to negotiate as a group entity and cover some amount more on top, and other not-totally-monetary payments \u0026ndash; and that\u0026rsquo;s okay.\nSome relationships are allowed to be transactional, or to be conditional. It\u0026rsquo;s okay for the employee-employer relationship to be one of those, and for both parties to be honest about that. The transactional and conditional nature of the relationship isn\u0026rsquo;t inherently toxic, it becomes so when the people involved forget that, or if one party deliberately obfuscates it. In fact, it\u0026rsquo;s healthier to be honest about that fact, because it allows for better clarity around boundaries (of course, undermining those boundaries is half the point of the rhetoric from toxic companies).\nEmployment Isn\u0026rsquo;t Permanent Even if you\u0026rsquo;re one of the lucky few who starts a job at 18 and stays in it until you retire, eventally, the employee-employer relationship will come to an end (hopefully before you die). In this day and age, it\u0026rsquo;s far more typical for that relationship to end far sooner.\nSomething I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed in my last layoff is that I got over what happened far more quickly than most of the other coworkers that I\u0026rsquo;ve kept in touch with. And while several of them were laid off for the first time (the first time\u0026rsquo;s always the worst), I can\u0026rsquo;t help but wonder if part of it was because they bought into the \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;re a family\u0026rdquo; thing. I\u0026rsquo;ve been laid off several times at this point, and one of the things that was different for me this time around was that I explicitly refused to buy into the \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;re a family\u0026rdquo; rhetoric.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t fault them for it. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to buy into it, especially with how pervasive the notion is in our society. When you work closely with people for most of your day, you form bonds and even friendships. The friendships between coworkers is immensely impactful and if you\u0026rsquo;re fortunate enough to forge friendships that last beyond the workplace, there\u0026rsquo;s a ton of value in that. But relationships among coworkers is different from the relationship with the employer and the company as a whole.\nCompanies Are Not Loyal To Their Workers For better or worse, companies do not give loyalty to their workers. Though there may have been a time where companies would invest more in their employees than they do now, it\u0026rsquo;s worth remembering that we have literally fought wars over corporate exploitation. The prominence of former University of Chicago professor Milton Friedman and his Friedman Doctrine, which for decades taught that a company\u0026rsquo;s only moral responsibility is to its shareholders (and not the other stakeholders, including its own workers), has exacerbated this anti-worker behavior thanks to how entrenched it has become in US economics and business.\nThis means the loyalty our culture pressures workers to put into companies is entirely one-sided, and no amount of giving more loyalty to a company is going to change that.\nSo What, Instead? At this point, I\u0026rsquo;m starting to feel like a broken record. Really, it all comes down to the fact that the \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;re a family\u0026rdquo; rhetoric opens the door for toxic and even abusive employee-employer relationships and worker exploitation. It\u0026rsquo;s a trap that plays on people\u0026rsquo;s emotions to manipulate them into giving more to the company than what\u0026rsquo;s owed and to get workers to give up their power.\nThankfully, there\u0026rsquo;s a better word for my workplace relationship with my coworkers that doesn\u0026rsquo;t inherently undermine the reality of employer-employee relations \u0026ndash; team.\nThat doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean unscrupulous managers or companies won\u0026rsquo;t try to exploit the team dynamic to manipulate workers (who hasn\u0026rsquo;t dealt with the \u0026ldquo;not a team player\u0026rdquo; criticism when trying to enforce a work boundary?). Such people will appeal to humans\u0026rsquo; cooperative nature no matter what word we use to describe it. However, remembering that this is a team in the context of a broader transactional and conditional relationship can help to remind us that it is okay to say no to too much work, or to negotiate having other work taken away to free up energy for the new work, in service of keeping healthy boundaries that allow you to uphold your side of the deal.\n","date":"Jan 27, 2024","description":"But they can be teams","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2024/01/27/companies-are-not-family/","series":null,"subtitle":null,"tags":["culture","civil rights"],"title":"Companies are not family"},{"categories":["finance"],"contents":"Looks at dates on blog posts.

And the director of engineering was champing at the bit to get me through the hiring process, so I could start as soon as possible. Thanksgiving was in there, though, so my first day wasn\u0026rsquo;t until December 21st.\nSide note: I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend starting a new job in the last couple of weeks of December like that. It\u0026rsquo;s hell to get onboarded, because half the company is out. Also, it makes taxes annoying.\nBut, I made it through the first holidays, got up and running with a shiny new M1 MacBook Pro and started firehosing all the tech. The first year was basically that, because there was just\u0026hellip;so\u0026hellip;much. That was fine, though. I got to visit the nearby in-house production facility, meet my coworkers and my users, and build a solid foundation within my team, and in year two, I really started taking off. I went from just doing stuff in my team, to working on a number of side initiatives with people from a bunch of teams \u0026ndash; and not just engineers. One of my first outside-the-team \u0026ldquo;work buddies\u0026rdquo; was actually the engineering manager of one of the other teams, with whom I worked closely to help get better documentation going (as it happened, he was one that voted to hire me), and more recently, I was the only non-manager on a kaizen team, until I pulled on a junior engineer who was looking into parallel work (yeah\u0026hellip;I did a double-take on that one, when I first got the calendar invite and did ask the organizer if that was right 😅 ). When my manager needed to do the quarterly review, I got to challenge his initial assessment with a page-long list of accomplishments. Suffice it to say, that assessment got bumped up.\nFast-forward to now, and\u0026hellip;I\u0026rsquo;m again without a job. Unfortunately, I was among the hefty chunk of people that got laid off as part of a strategic move. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really surprised by this, given the fact that they closed the in-house production facility where all my work was with.\nI swear, I\u0026rsquo;m cosmically disallowed from having a job for more than 2 years.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not that I don\u0026rsquo;t want to work for the same company for more than that. It\u0026rsquo;s just that something always seems to come up by that time. Maybe one day, I\u0026rsquo;ll have a job long enough to actually use two hands when measuring my tenure in years.\nAh well\u0026hellip;such is life. On to the next thing, I guess.\nA Mental Health Side Note That Star Wars gif reminded me of something \u0026ndash; ironically from the very post I shamelessly pulled it from. When I first wrote that post, I was dealing with Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria after being rejected for a job I wasn\u0026rsquo;t even looking for and had zero stakes about getting.\nAt that time, that was the best case scenario I\u0026rsquo;d ever had when it came to employment in general. I was doing work I liked, my house had enough income to handle bills, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t need the job, it just looked like neat work to pick up for however long it worked out for. By all accounts, it should have been a big nothing burger, and yet it took me a full 24 hours to dig myself out of the funk the rejection put me in.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;ve lost jobs many, many times before. Technically, only once was a strategic layoff like this, but several others were due to toxic environments where cutting ties was very much a good thing. But regardless of the circumstances, the immediate aftermath would trigger the dysphoria and the grief cycle (ironically, something I touched on in that post, too; I guess some things don\u0026rsquo;t change).\nThis time around was starkly different.\nEven as I watched my co-workers go through the grief cycle, Han Solo lived rent-free in my brain for like two weeks after that, because it was exactly how I felt. In fact, I had to hold myself back from kicking into high gear on \u0026ldquo;the next chapter\u0026rdquo; stuff, since I immediately wanted to update my resume and start poking the job boards, not because I needed to (even without the tail-end income due to paperwork timing vs payroll, severance, and so on, I\u0026rsquo;ve positioned us well, financially), but because I\u0026hellip;well\u0026hellip;wanted to. Well\u0026hellip;that and ADHD plus LinkedIn when I\u0026rsquo;m trying to write recommendations for people meant I ended up on the job list on occasion, where I found intriguing, high-profile opportunities that I didn\u0026rsquo;t (at the time) want to pass up.\nAm I saddened by the loss of the culture we had? You bet. Am I frustrated at yet another job falling through within 2 years? Yep. Will I miss the coworkers that I\u0026rsquo;ll inevitably drift apart from? You know it. Am I frustrated that I was just starting to take off, and now this will set me back in some ways? Uh huh.\nBut for the lost job itself and the fact that I was one of the ones caught in the net? I literally could not have cared less. In fact, I got more annoyed by the condolences every time I had to tell people, because even as empty platitudes, it felt like they cared more than I did, and that\u0026rsquo;s saying something.\nAlmost a month since I got the news, and I\u0026rsquo;m still marveling at that fact.\nOkay, but why is this the case this time? Honestly, I have no fucking clue. My only guess is that it\u0026rsquo;s a combination of everything that has just overwhelmed that part. It was undeniably a good gig for me while it lasted, and I ended up with a laundry list of things to prove it.\nI started getting recommendations in LinkedIn (unsolicited! And before I recommended them!) I have pages and pages of accomplishments, not just in code work, but also in tangential/\u0026ldquo;glue\u0026rdquo; work I can attach numbers to the impact of my core work I was able to arrange household expenses such that we can live off one income without issue (yay, no stress about making ends meet!) I was one of a great many people who also got laid off (which further amplifies how impersonal it is and feels) I did a bunch of work that I\u0026rsquo;m proud of, giving me plenty to draw from in the future I learned a ton of useful stuff that I can carry forward Arguably, this shouldn\u0026rsquo;t mitigate dysphoria, because it\u0026rsquo;s not really a \u0026ldquo;logical\u0026rdquo; thing. It\u0026rsquo;s like Depression \u0026ndash; there\u0026rsquo;s no \u0026ldquo;logical reason\u0026rdquo; to feel it, you just do, because brain chemicals and adrenal system and central nervous system stuff. The act of receiving the news that I no longer had a job should have itself triggered it, and yet, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t bring myself to care (in a good, \u0026ldquo;water off a duck\u0026rsquo;s back\u0026rdquo; sort of way).\nDealt With A Delinquent Former Client (Kinda) That was an adventure\u0026hellip;\nAs I wound down my freelance stuff, since working full time took all of my energy, my last client started getting super flaky. Some half a dozen unpaid invoices later, and I had the\u0026hellip; ahem \u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;pleasure\u0026rdquo; of attempting to serve him for nonpayment.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s stupidly harder than it should be.\nI ended up out some $1500, because we couldn\u0026rsquo;t actually track him down at the known addresses we had, and the notification about that always came after the court dates. 😡\nLesson learned on that front. I\u0026rsquo;ll deal with the overhead of being on a platform like Gun.io or the one I had started with that client on if it means I\u0026rsquo;m not the one that has to chase down payments. The other frustrating part, too, was that they had been good about paying for years at that point, until one day they just\u0026hellip;weren\u0026rsquo;t.\nGot Student Loan Forgiveness Stuff The DeVry settlement finally went through! 🥳\nAnd because I was dirt poor when I got those loans, I got a decent chunk from the Biden thing, too. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t the full advertised amount, because of what I make now, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay.\nBetween that and the \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;re sorry for the former administration\u0026rsquo;s asshattery about this\u0026rdquo; interest forgiveness, my student loans are now about half of what they had once been. I can work with that (which is good, because that also means the forbearance is over, unless I apply for the regular kind\u0026hellip;but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to if I don\u0026rsquo;t need to, and I don\u0026rsquo;t need to).\nPaid Off A Few Bills\u0026hellip;And Added A Couple More On the personal finance front, I got a couple of bills paid off! 🥳 \u0026hellip;Though I did add a couple others. Still a net gain, though.\nPreviously, I mentioned getting a home equity line of credit. It was great for why we got it, and it served its purpose, but it was a variable rate loan.\n\u0026hellip;you can probably see where I\u0026rsquo;m going with this one\u0026hellip;\nIt recently became my highest-interest loan, something I saw coming as soon as the rates started rising. And at a whopping 10%, it became financially better to dip into my savings account to pay it off. So I did exactly that back in November (perfect timing, I know; story of my life).\nI paid off a few others, too, though I\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten what they are at this point.\nThey were replaced with a loan for solar panels and a new bed. The bed was needed, because we weren\u0026rsquo;t sleeping properly anymore on the old one.\nThe Solar Panel Debacle The solar panels were intended to be essentially cash flowed with the electric bill savings. That one\u0026hellip;partially worked.\nMy house is actually quite ideal for solar panels, and the panels produce even a little more than what they\u0026rsquo;re estimated for. Unfortunately\u0026hellip;the company we got them from did not estimate for 100% of our usage. That\u0026rsquo;s\u0026hellip;its own story for another time. I don\u0026rsquo;t regret getting them, though I do wish I\u0026rsquo;d gotten them from someone else.\nAh, well\u0026hellip;live and learn, and hopefully, in a decade or so when their efficiency drops off, there\u0026rsquo;ll be better options with which to replace them. In the meantime, I\u0026rsquo;ll enjoy the discounted electric bill.\nBought A Car With Cash This was just fun, I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest. With the pandemic winding down and the family doing more things out of the house, we needed a second car, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t want another loan. The car didn\u0026rsquo;t need to be brand new, since we mostly needed it for the occasional time when we were both out of the house for one reason or another.\nSo, I figured out what our budget was, then we checked out the \u0026ldquo;under $15k\u0026rdquo; options at a few of the local dealerships. We eventually found one that worked for us, and had the joy of writing a check for the amount and driving off the lot owning it outright.\nBehold! The power of money management!\nI\u0026rsquo;m glad I did it that way, too. The car\u0026rsquo;s been solid for us so far, with only a little bit of maintenance cost that wasn\u0026rsquo;t unexpected, given the mileage. And now, in light of my current lack of a job, owning it outright means I\u0026rsquo;m not sitting on a relatively new loan that I have to worry about paying on top of all the other stuff.\nStarted A New Chapter One thing I\u0026rsquo;ve learned about the timing and nature of the jobs I\u0026rsquo;ve lost is that there\u0026rsquo;s very often a reason it happened when it did. In the distant past, it was because I needed to shed certain toxic things from my life. More recently, it\u0026rsquo;s been because a unique opportunity is about to arise for me, and I need to be ready for it. In some cases, things were rough for a bit, but in all of them, my life has improved in some way. This time is no different.\nIn the Discord group with a bunch of my former coworkers, someone asked, \u0026ldquo;has anyone thought of doing something completely crazy career-wise?\u0026rdquo; I replied that I have on more than a few occasions (no surprise, really, right?), which prompted another coworker to reach out to me about a friend of hers who\u0026rsquo;s working on getting his gaming company off the ground and got me in touch with him. We hit it off, and since I\u0026rsquo;m in a position to take a risk on something super early stage, I agreed to join! \u0026#x1f389;\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll see how this going.

It\u0026rsquo;s annoying as hell, and made yet more annoying by the fact that not a single help forum seems to acknowledge this is even an issue! I have found some half a dozen posts dating back to 2019 with the same symptoms and the same brain-dead \u0026ldquo;answers\u0026rdquo; and none of them actually fix the problem!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s infuriating!\nAll the responses are the same (if there are responses and it\u0026rsquo;s not just locked without any), I shit you not.\nYou must be logged into the wrong account (\u0026hellip;except when I know for a fact that I\u0026rsquo;m using the right account and can open other sheets on that same account) Ask the owner to give you edit permission (I\u0026rsquo;m the owner!)

In the middle of editing, I get the \u0026ldquo;this has changed significantly, reload to sync\u0026rdquo; message. Pay no mind to the fact that I\u0026rsquo;m the only person with edit permission and I\u0026rsquo;ve been editing on the same device all day. Where is this message even coming from?\nNow, it had been a while since I ran into it, so I tried searching to see if any solution was ever posted. Nope. Still the same old useless garbage.\nBut! I\u0026rsquo;m a software engineer! It\u0026rsquo;s literally my job to track down stupid shit like this and figure out fixes, even when nothing is documented. And I\u0026rsquo;m angry. It\u0026rsquo;s been a long day, and I just wanted to give my Ranger his feat after a hard-won fight that at multiple different points nearly saw him kidnapped or killed. I earned that edit, dammit!\nSo\u0026hellip;I started poking around and playing the \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rsquo;s this button do?\u0026rdquo; game. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing in the app itself, since the app\u0026hellip;you know\u0026hellip;(rightly) assumes the owner has edit access.\nHowever\u0026hellip; device settings has some things: clear cache and clear app data.\nAnd it makes sense. Randomly breaking, and more importantly, randomly fixing issues tend to point to caching issues of some sort. So, I cleared the cache and restarted the app.\n\u0026hellip;except that didn\u0026rsquo;t work.\nOkay, fine. I didn\u0026rsquo;t actually know what clearing app data would do to my Google Drive stuff, since I\u0026rsquo;ve never had to do it. Who knows what tedium awaited me down that path. But, I was at the point of wanting to solve this out of spite. It had been a rough day, and damnit, I wanted something.\nSo I hit the button and cleared the data.\nThen, I opened Drive back up, half expecting to need to re-authenticate or something.\nLo and behold, it worked! It actually fucking worked! After two years of running into this problem just intermittently enough to piss me off, I finally found the (user-accessible) solution!\nHopefully, this will help the next poor sap who runs into this issue, and finds themselves scouring the Internet for how to solve this problem that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t even be a problem to begin with.\nEven if that next poor sap is future me.\n","date":"Nov 17, 2023","description":"I finally f*ing found it","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2023/11/17/fixing-the-google-sheets-view-only-bug/","series":null,"subtitle":null,"tags":["bugs"],"title":"Fixing The Google Sheets View Only Bug"},{"categories":["community","tech"],"contents":"Holy shit, I actually just did a talk\u0026hellip;\u0026ldquo;in front of\u0026rdquo; a few hundred people\u0026hellip;for over an hour\u0026hellip; \u0026#x1f631;\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure you, dear reader, fully grasp the gravity of that.\nSee, fear of public speaking/stage fright (aka \u0026ldquo;glossophobia\u0026rdquo;) has been a thing that\u0026rsquo;s haunted me for\u0026hellip;basically my entire life. Incessant school bullying and an emotionally abusive head-of-household with a particular enjoyment of telling a 7 year old child everything they did wrong during the school performance, plus dealing with the fallout from a spouse\u0026rsquo;s undiagnosed mental illness will kind of do that to a person.\nHell, I even talked about all that almost four years ago. Ironically, I never did take Cal up on his invites and I\u0026rsquo;ve since lost a large portion of that particular network, but the latter was largely because I basically outgrew a lot of those people. They were better than my at-the-time-current situation, by far, but once I got that foundation, I realized that many of them weren\u0026rsquo;t actually that great (and many others, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a choice in the matter). So now, that support network is far smaller, but I\u0026rsquo;ve traded quantity for much higher quality. I can be myself in ways I realized I couldn\u0026rsquo;t before. I\u0026rsquo;ll take that trade any day.\nBut Back To The Talk\u0026hellip; Last Monday, Rehgan Avon, the creator of Women in Analytics and organizer of its annual conference, messaged me about doing a tutorial on Github at the conference.\nAlmost before I could think twice, I basically leaped at the opportunity, pausing just long enough to make sure I could fit the available block into my schedule.\nIt really wasn\u0026rsquo;t until yesterday evening that I actually thought \u0026ldquo;what the hell did I get myself into?\u0026rdquo; Honestly, it probably didn\u0026rsquo;t help that after seeing several of the talks and keynotes by a bunch of women with \u0026ldquo;executive\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;director\u0026rdquo; in their titles at \u0026ldquo;big, well-known company,\u0026rdquo; I felt like a minnow in the freaking ocean.\nBut\u0026hellip;I did it, and it was a success!\n\u0026hellip;and holy hell, I\u0026rsquo;m in a weird state of fatigue right now (because I literally just did it\u0026hellip;like\u0026hellip;this afternoon). I\u0026rsquo;m totally not used to doing a talk for 75 minutes and it definitely showed toward the end, when I started tripping over my words. I not have the stamina for that length of talk without some amount of conversational piece (like a panel or round table).\nAnd It Wasn\u0026rsquo;t Scripted! What I\u0026rsquo;m particularly both proud of and astounded by is the fact that I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel the need to read off of a script. I created an outline and a slide deck (though I ended up all but abandoning the deck once I got into the hands-on part; if I ever do something like it again, I\u0026rsquo;ll probably nix that section entirely and just keep the rest as a reference outline to make sure I cover everything I want to), but the talking part was just\u0026hellip;talking.\nThat slide deck is the first of a collection of Hugo+Reveal slide decks, by the way. \u0026#x1f601;\nSo What Changed? This really just goes to show just how important psychological safety is, at least for me. Some conscious decisions on my own part to be more assertive and to go about things in the way that works for me has also helped tremendously.\nHad she asked me 5 years ago to do this, my response would have been \u0026ldquo;hell. No\u0026rdquo; (more diplomatically and polite, of course). A lot of that has to do with the fact that 5 years ago, I was still super worried about what others thought of me and felt the need to do and say things that people expect, in an effort to gain their approval, and I had no social or psychological safety net.\nSince then, I:\nhad a manager and mentor who was awesome at helping me gain confidence in my professional life uncovered and fixed the cause of the psychological erosion in my home life made the decision to just do my thing and if people like it, great, if not, that\u0026rsquo;s okay (why, hello, \u0026ldquo;own yo\u0026rsquo; shit\u0026rdquo; core value) have put up a number of\u0026hellip;shall we say, unapologetic posts on my blog, which have gotten a lot of positive reception (it\u0026rsquo;s part of \u0026ldquo;doing my thing,\u0026rdquo; but it\u0026rsquo;s still nice to see that it\u0026rsquo;s still attracting good people to my life) ","date":"Feb 11, 2021","description":"...I can't believe I actually did it...","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2021/02/11/that-one-where-i-talk-for-an-hour/","series":null,"subtitle":null,"tags":["community contribution","events"],"title":"That One Where I Talk For An Hour"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"So I happened to notice the other day that my site gets a lot more traffic than I realized (thanks, PointHQ!), so I tossed a little, lightweight analytics thing onto it so I can see where people are going and maybe we\u0026rsquo;re they\u0026rsquo;re coming from. (Hi, people! \u0026#x1f44b;)\nOne of the things I noticed was that an old, old blog post of mine was getting hit. Like\u0026hellip;so old that I didn\u0026rsquo;t migrate it originally, considering it defunct and no longer applicable.\nApparently, I was wrong.\nAnd people are still interested in it.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ve resurrected it (this is why I kept a backup of my old blog \u0026#x1f609;), but I also found myself wanting to make a bunch of notes on it. Since I try to avoid doing that as much as possible, I figured I\u0026rsquo;d write an update to it.\nAll Good Things Must End I ended up doing the Shipt thing only until about October. I had wanted to try to keep doing it after I started working full time again, but that just didn\u0026rsquo;t happen. It didn\u0026rsquo;t help that by that time, they had made changes such that it became infeasible for me to do so, given the nature of the Central Ohio market. (The work essentially dried up for the times I was available.)\nIt was fun while it lasted, though, and I do miss a couple of the repeat customers I had. That time, especially during the earlier months, showed how such a service could have been, I think.\nThe Grocery Store Sector Is Weird The competition in the grocery sector is weird. I never would have thought that grocery stores would get all up in arms about third parties that literally come in and pay retail price with a value-add model.\nBy the time I quit doing it, Shipt was about to head into the third chain here \u0026ndash; Meijer. When Shipt originally came here, they had been going to Giant Eagle. That lasted all of about a week before Giant Eagle kicked them out (apparently it was pretty hostile, too). Kroger was cool with it for a little while, but soon got weird about it as they started preparing to launch their own curbside thing (from the looks of Shipt\u0026rsquo;s marketing, that relationship seems to have improved; Covid probably helped show that there was plenty of room for everyone).\nTarget clearly loved the idea enough to straight-up buy them, which kind of makes Shipt\u0026rsquo;s ability to shop at a bunch of the other stores even more weird. You\u0026rsquo;d think that if they only begrudgingly accept an independent third party throwing money at them, they\u0026rsquo;d hate a comptitor doing it and basically getting extra money on top. And yet, there are now more store options in a given area than ever.\nThe Gig Economy Goes To Pot Circa 2017 is when the rose colored glasses about the gig or \u0026ldquo;platform\u0026rdquo; economy as a whole had fallen apart to the point irreparability. The time I stopped working for Shipt is about the same time Uber started getting beat over the head by the regulation and legal bat for worker misclassification, wage theft, and other issues. Other gig platforms flew under the radar, but from what I saw, they were doing not-dissimilar things, albeit in more subtle ways.\nShipt was no different, unfortunately. They started with \u0026ldquo;metrics\u0026rdquo; that were ostensibly \u0026ldquo;guides\u0026rdquo; for the shoppers. Things like pass rate (how many available orders a shopper passes on), rating based on whether the delivery was logged late (there was something like this when I started, but it became more extensive as time went on), overall rating minimums (the damage from \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t do 5 stars because no one\u0026rsquo;s perfect\u0026rdquo; customers be damned; and I\u0026rsquo;d hate to have been a shopper this past March and April), and a few others I\u0026rsquo;ve since forgotten. The initial claim was that they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t affect anything.\nThat claim is never true. Ever.\nAs soon as something starts getting measured, it starts being used for judgement, for better or worse.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t long before that was the case, and various other little changes started making it feel like they were dancing around the line between \u0026ldquo;independent contractor\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;defacto employee,\u0026rdquo; while still vehemently trying to sell the line that we really, truly, were independent.\nApparently, issues like that just got worse, up to and including a switch to a more opaque payment structure that many say resulted in a pay reduction, and even dropping people with essentially no notice and no info (the reviews on Indeed are astoundingly scathing).\nThe Tip Structure Sucked In doing some digging for up to date information to see if/how things have changed, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen fleeting mention that they\u0026rsquo;ve attempted to encourage 10% tips, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if that\u0026rsquo;s stuck (what I\u0026rsquo;m finding more of, actually, are a number of issues that prevented shoppers from getting tips at all, at least on some orders).\nWhen I was doing it, though, the tip options were fixed values that had no bearing on the size of the order. This meant that on more than one occasion, if I got a tip at all, it was $5\u0026hellip;on a $100+ order.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve tipped the 5 Guys crew more than that. \u0026#x1f611;\nNow, to be fair, there were some awesome tippers, too. One customer would reliably tip something like $20 or $25, even though his orders were generally only about $50, he trusted the shopper to make substitutes, and wanted his order left on his porch.\nThat guy was by far one of my favorites and most memorable, and I\u0026rsquo;ve never even seen his face.\nHowever, $5 tips, regardless of order value, was the norm, in no small part because that\u0026rsquo;s how the system was set up. Most designers will tell you that most people will invariably select the lowest tip value if presented with options. Let\u0026rsquo;s just say that getting $5 for a $150 order for picky upper-middle-class soccer moms got old (seriously, I swear there\u0026rsquo;s an inverse correlation between affluency and relative tip amount; were it not for the couple of customers I liked who happened to be in the higher-end zones, I\u0026rsquo;d have dropped the affluent zones altogether in favor of the less affluent ones, because those customers were so much more enjoyable and rewarding to shop for).\nShopper-Customer Ratio Issues One thing they never did seem to get right is the balance of shoppers to customers, especially in the smaller markets. The result was a sort of \u0026ldquo;feast-famine\u0026rdquo; cycle, where there\u0026rsquo;d be high competition for a short supply of orders, or a slew of orders that go to \u0026ldquo;promo,\u0026rdquo; because they weren\u0026rsquo;t getting picked up.\nNow, to be fair, this is a harder problem to solve than one might expect, because humans. However, you\u0026rsquo;d think after four years of launching in a bunch of cities, they\u0026rsquo;d have it figured out at least a little better, but apparently that\u0026rsquo;s not the case.\nLack of Order Stacking I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it\u0026rsquo;s grown since I left, but the Columbus market was quite small while I was working there. Between the sheer lack of orders, the distance between stores within even a given range, and the aforementioned Shopper-Customer ratio issues, being able to double up on orders was exceedingly rare. I think in 8 or so months I was doing it, I had maybe 3 or 4 opportunities to double up, and of them, maybe one wasn\u0026rsquo;t really forced. The rest, I had pushed them kind of to their limit and in fact on at least one, I ended up a couple minutes late, because the two locations were basically on the opposite ends of their respective areas and about as far away from one another as they could possibly get while still being in adjacent zones.\nThat lack of opportunity to stack orders meant lack of opportunity to get more than the $8-9/hr average that I had calculated initially, making it increasingly not worth it (and really not worth it now, if the criticisms of the new algorithm are accurate and company-wide). That order stacking is what makes the whole system worthwhile at the line level. Without that, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much dead in the water.\nThe Memory Lane Cul-de-Sac At this point, I don\u0026rsquo;t really have much more to say. It was fun while it lasted, and I genuinely did enjoy the experience. It was also valuable to me for helping me get back to my roots for working, more generally. I found what had slowly disappeared over the years in my job \u0026ndash; that ability to make someone\u0026rsquo;s day and get paid doing it \u0026ndash; and how much I missed that.\nI also am genuinely saddened by the trajectory I\u0026rsquo;ve seen the company take in more recent years. They could have grown into something that really stood out from the competition in an increasingly crowded market, and instead, they\u0026rsquo;ve largely chosen the same underhanded techniques the others have, and because of that, I can\u0026rsquo;t really recommend them anymore. \u0026#x1f61e;\n","date":"Feb 10, 2021","description":"It's a sad, downhill path, IMO.","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2021/02/10/a-look-back-at-shipt/","series":null,"subtitle":"And The Gig Economy More Generally","tags":["something different","shipt"],"title":"A Look Back At Shipt"},{"categories":["teaching","tech"],"contents":"The most important skill in tech isn\u0026rsquo;t the technology. It\u0026rsquo;s problem-solving. Whether you get into cyber security, system administration, or programming, the heart of all of it is really the ability to take a problem, break it apart, and work out a solution \u0026ndash; very often coming up with solutions that didn\u0026rsquo;t previously exist at all. Even on the more everyday scale, you\u0026rsquo;ll be constantly faced with error messages, odd software behavior, broken tests, and more that you\u0026rsquo;ll be expected to triage and if not fix yourself, hand off detailed information about the problem to those who can fix it.\nLikewise, the second most important skill is knowing when \u0026ndash; and how \u0026ndash; to ask for help when you\u0026rsquo;ve reached the limits of your current knowledge. Knowing how to ask good questions when asking for help goes a long way toward not just getting an answer or lead, but also for getting a relevant answer or lead that takes you closer to your final solution.\nBut for both of these, we need to build the foundations. We don\u0026rsquo;t just enter the world knowing how to solve problems and find answers and ask questions. These are skills we must develop like any other, and unfortunately, they aren\u0026rsquo;t really explicitly taught like other skills are. Let\u0026rsquo;s change that.\nProblem Solving You\u0026rsquo;re working on a project (or assignment) and suddenly you get stuck. Maybe you encounter an error (or maybe you don\u0026rsquo;t), or the documentation you\u0026rsquo;re working with is incomplete or even incorrect. What do you do now?\nBelieve it or not, problem-solving is highly procedural. There are some places where you might make different decisions or have different options, but the process is largely the same.\nStep 1 - Assess The Situation How do you know there\u0026rsquo;s something wrong? Are there error messages anywhere? Is the UI not what is expected?\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t know the answer to these questions, then take a minute to first list what should be. Should the test pass? Should the application run? Should the background be a particular shade of blue? Or, for physical-world application examples, should the car start? Should the paint roller roll smoothly? Should the vacuum pick up the mess? This is your desired or expected state; your \u0026ldquo;Point B.\u0026rdquo; Knowing this will help you determine how the current state differs, and thus, what is broken.\nThe current state is your \u0026ldquo;Point A.\u0026rdquo; Problem solving is the process of getting from A to B, not unlike plotting a route between two geographical locations. Just like with navigation, if your Point A and Point B match, then you\u0026rsquo;re already there and there\u0026rsquo;s no problem. But, of course, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be here if that was the case.\nSo, now that you have your list of what should be, compile your list of what is.\nAre there error messages? Be sure to check all potential output locations. Sometimes there are multiple terminals it could output to, or there might also be a log file. Depending on what you\u0026rsquo;re working with, they might not be text-based messages. They might be lights \u0026ndash; such as the dead battery indicator on your car dashboard. They might be sounds \u0026ndash; such as the beep sounds from a computer.\nIf there aren\u0026rsquo;t any error messages, then compare the current state with the intended state. This is the part where most people stop, because they don\u0026rsquo;t look deep enough. Most people get to this point, declare \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s not working\u0026rdquo; and immediately expect someone else to step in. The key to good problem solving, though, is not stopping here, but digging deeper and seeing exactly what\u0026rsquo;s wrong.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s different? What\u0026rsquo;s missing from the current state that should be there? What\u0026rsquo;s there that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be?\nTake, for example, your (gas-powered) car not starting. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t start. What\u0026rsquo;s wrong with it? Even with a fairly rudimentary knowledge of cars, you could probably name off half a dozen possibilities. If you know a bit more about cars, though, you probably also know that each of those possibilities display different symptoms \u0026ndash; and it\u0026rsquo;s those symptoms you need to seek out.\nSo your car won\u0026rsquo;t start. Did the lights come on when you opened the door? What happens when you try to start it? Does the dashboard light up when you turn the key into the \u0026ldquo;on\u0026rdquo; position? When you turn the key to the \u0026ldquo;start\u0026rdquo; position, does the engine even try to \u0026ldquo;turn over\u0026rdquo; or does nothing happen at all? If the engine tries to start, what does it sound like? Is it a steady whir, or does it sound like it\u0026rsquo;s gaining and losing energy? Does it run when the key is in the \u0026ldquo;start\u0026rdquo; position, but die once you let go? Do you even get the \u0026ldquo;click\u0026rdquo; sound that immediately precedes the engine starting?\nThe same line of questioning is necessary in tech, too. Did you get the prompt you were supposed to get? Did it even attempt to install its dependencies? If it attempted, was it successful? Are the expected UI elements present and where they should be?\nWhat If I Don\u0026rsquo;t Know Anything About The Thing? It\u0026rsquo;s really easy to fall into the trap of \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know enough to do this part!\u0026rdquo;\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the thing: you know more about your current situation than you\u0026rsquo;re giving yourself credit for, and you have more information at your disposal than you think.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re doing something totally new, you probably already have documentation and other instructional information open. These provide you information about the intended state, even if they don\u0026rsquo;t explicitly state it, through images and statements that indicate expectation of something being in a certain place.\nIf a tutorial tells us to click on an icon, but that icon isn\u0026rsquo;t there, then that\u0026rsquo;s our indication that something is missing or off. Our next step is then to make note of that missing bit. We don\u0026rsquo;t have that icon. Okay, why not? Are we working with the same version that the instructions are working with? Did we miss something that needed set up? Did the instructions miss a setup step? (This happens, too. It\u0026rsquo;s actually quite difficult for subject matter experts to create thorough beginner instructions on the first pass. The best documentation generally involves several reviewers and many edits.)\nStep 2 - Interpret The Data Take some time to think about what the data you\u0026rsquo;ve gathered means. Come up with hypotheses about the likely issues.\nGoing back to the car \u0026ndash; perhaps it does try to \u0026ldquo;turn over.* The lights also came on when you opened the door, and the dash lights up as expected. That means the battery probably isn\u0026rsquo;t dead (or at least not totally dead), right? So what does that leave us with? That leaves us with things like not enough gas or oil, a problem with the spark plug, and a more severe problem with the ingition, among some other things. Well, gas is fairly easy to check \u0026ndash; where\u0026rsquo;s the gauge sitting at when the car is on? If it\u0026rsquo;s not empty, it\u0026rsquo;s probably not out of gas. We also see that the \u0026ldquo;check engine\u0026rdquo; light isn\u0026rsquo;t on, so it\u0026rsquo;s likely not a more severe engine problem. So now, most of the rest of the stuff requires us to move to a different part of the car.\nStep 3 - Repeat Steps 1 And 2 (If Necessary) Our goal right now is to reach a testable hypothesis \u0026ndash; a change that we can make to see if we get a different result. Until now, we\u0026rsquo;ve been able to rule out problems just from gathering and interpreting data, and our process has led us to another part of the vehicle. So now, we have to re-assess.\nSo we pop the hood and take a look inside to see if anything sticks out. Checking the oil shows that we have enough, so we can rule that out. But when we get to the spark plug, we notice that it\u0026rsquo;s quite black and there doesn\u0026rsquo;t appear to be much space between the nodes.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not what a spark plug is supposed to look like. There\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be a decent gap between the nodes and they\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be bare metal. Instead, it\u0026rsquo;s gunked up with carbon.\nStep 4 - Test The Hypothesis Now we have a testable hypothesis \u0026ndash; the car won\u0026rsquo;t start because the spark plug is gunked up. So we grab a rag and clean it up, making sure the nodes are nice and clear, and put it back in its place. Finally, we start the car.\nStep 5 - Reassess Does the car start? If so, great! We found the problem and fixed it!\nBut sometimes, it\u0026rsquo;s not as simple as that. Perhaps now, when we try to start it, it starts fine\u0026hellip;but as soon as we let go of the key, it stalls out.\nNow what?\nProgress! Believe it or not, we\u0026rsquo;ve actually made progress toward fixing the problem, even though it still doesn\u0026rsquo;t start yet. How do we know?\nBecause the car now behaves differently. Remember: our original main symptom was that the engine would not turn over and get to that fully started state that we\u0026rsquo;re looking for when we turn the key to start it. Now that we\u0026rsquo;ve cleaned the spark plug, it does that! \u0026hellip;It now just doesn\u0026rsquo;t stay that way.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s our cue that what we\u0026rsquo;ve done has made a difference, but there\u0026rsquo;s still something else wrong.\nNow, in tech, sometimes that change in behavior doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually move us toward our goal. It might even move us away from it. But that\u0026rsquo;s okay. What matters here is the change itself. The action we\u0026rsquo;ve taken has resulted in a state change and that change gives us valuable information.\nAnd what if nothing changes? Well, that also gives us information, though admittedly not as useful or satisfying as a state change. We can, however, conclude that our hypothesis didn\u0026rsquo;t affect what we thought it would. In the car situation, perhaps the engine still won\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;turn over.\u0026rdquo; Well, that means the starter being dirty wasn\u0026rsquo;t the problem. (Now, this is where the analogy fails us a little, because we can\u0026rsquo;t really \u0026ldquo;unclean\u0026rdquo; a spark plug \u0026ndash; nor would we want to \u0026ndash; but in tech, we would revert the change we just made, so that we ensure our working state is as it was initially, or we risk compounding our issues and not knowing what the actual cause or solution turned out to be.)\nStep 6 - Rinse And Repeat Not only is problem-solving highly procedural, it\u0026rsquo;s also cyclical. This assess-interpret-test cycle is repeated over and over until you\u0026rsquo;ve either fixed the problem, or exhausted your hypotheses. Hopefully, during the process, you generate more hypotheses as you gather more data, so that you reach your solution before you run out of ideas.\nAsking For Help Sometimes, though, we do run out of ideas. Or maybe we just get \u0026ldquo;caught in the weeds\u0026rdquo; and find ourselves going in circles. We\u0026rsquo;re too close to the problem now that we\u0026rsquo;re looking at every proverbial blade of grass with a magnifying glass, when what we need is to take a step back and look at the whole picture.\n\u0026hellip;and sometimes we just need someone to force us back to basics.\nKnowing When To Ask For Help Putting a hard-and-fast clock time to when we should ask for help\u0026hellip;doesn\u0026rsquo;t really work too well. A time that one person finds too long could just as easily be \u0026ldquo;too short\u0026rdquo; for someone else. However, if we use the above problem-solving process, we can better gauge when a good time to ask is.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s because it\u0026rsquo;s less about the amount of time we\u0026rsquo;ve spent (at least beyond the extremes of 30 seconds and 12 hours or days), and more about being able to demonstrate what we\u0026rsquo;ve tried and articulating that our hypotheses have failed. So, the \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; amount of time is the amount of time it takes to go through the problem-solving cycle at least a couple of times.\nKnowing How To Ask For Help After we\u0026rsquo;ve decided that we need to ask for help, we need to determine how to ask. Believe it or not, there are better and worse ways to ask for help!\nJust saying \u0026ldquo;it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, help me fix it!\u0026rdquo; is a bad way to ask for help, because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t give the person helping any information about what\u0026rsquo;s wrong, what information we\u0026rsquo;ve gathered, what we\u0026rsquo;ve already tried (or even that we\u0026rsquo;ve tried anything), or who else we\u0026rsquo;ve asked (and what they\u0026rsquo;ve come up with). Coming to a person with this forces them to do a bunch of investigative work just to be able to get the context needed to help.\nGetting help faster means we need to preempt that investigative step by providing the contextual information needed to get them up to speed. So, instead of \u0026ldquo;it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work!\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m totally lost!\u0026rdquo; we can use what we gathered in the problem-solving cycle to build out a better request.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say we weren\u0026rsquo;t able to fix the car, so we call our mechanic friend. Instead of saying, \u0026ldquo;Joe! My car won\u0026rsquo;t start! Help!\u0026rdquo; we do the following:\nHey Joe, my car won\u0026rsquo;t start and I\u0026rsquo;ve exhausted my knowledge. I was hoping you could help me out.\nWhen I first tried to start it, the engine would try to start, but not actually be successful. The lights all worked and the gas meter says I still have half a tank. I checked the oil and it seems fine, and I checked the spark plug. It was dirty, so I cleaned it and tried to start the car again. After I did that, the car would start, but now doesn\u0026rsquo;t stay running once I let go of the key.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s about my limit of knowledge, so I tried an Internet search to see what it might be and where to go from here, but all the suggestions seem to need tools I don\u0026rsquo;t have or require taking it to a mechanic shop, which would require me to get it towed. Do you have any ideas I could try \u0026ndash; or do you think you could look at it with the tools you have \u0026ndash; before I resort to getting it taken in?\nNotice the elements we have here:\nThe specific, overarching issue (the car won\u0026rsquo;t start) Symptoms of the issue (won\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;turn over\u0026rdquo;) What we\u0026rsquo;ve already tried (assessed the battery and fuel level, checked the oil, cleaned the spark plug) What changed after we tried something (engine now starts, but won\u0026rsquo;t stay running) Indication of research attempt and findings The help request, which includes a \u0026ldquo;self-help\u0026rdquo; (what else can I do to troubleshoot this problem and maybe fix it myself?) as well as a \u0026ldquo;full-service\u0026rdquo; (is this something you might be able to fix for me?) option This gives Joe enough information to pick up where we\u0026rsquo;ve left off, without having to ask his own probing questions just to find out what we\u0026rsquo;ve tried and what symptoms we\u0026rsquo;re observing or repeating work we\u0026rsquo;ve already done. It also demonstrates that we\u0026rsquo;ve tried to solve the problem ourselves, including stretching our current level of knowledge.\nRubber-Ducking Sometimes (most times, really), we don\u0026rsquo;t actually need the other person\u0026rsquo;s help. We need the perspective that we gain through the act of making a good request for help. This is because the act of explaining the full context forces us to slow down and look at what we\u0026rsquo;re actually looking at, instead of what we think we\u0026rsquo;re looking at (our brain\u0026rsquo;s are fantastic at filling in details that aren\u0026rsquo;t actually there).\nThis is where \u0026ldquo;rubber duck debugging\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;rubber ducking\u0026rdquo; comes in. Rubber ducking is the process of explaining in great detail to something (traditionally a rubber duck, but it can be anything) the problem that you\u0026rsquo;re having. The idea is that the duck has zero context for your problem, so you must provide it that context. The act of providing that context forces you go over everything you\u0026rsquo;ve done, what worked, what didn\u0026rsquo;t, what problems there are, what confounding factors there are, and more, with a fine-toothed comb. The key, though, is actually talking it out, hence the external, inanimate object.\nTry it!\n","date":"Oct 21, 2020","description":"With ducks!","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2020/10/21/on-problem-solving/","series":null,"subtitle":"(And Effectively Asking For Help)","tags":["personal growth","tips"],"title":"On Problem Solving"},{"categories":["community"],"contents":"I was turned down for a job today.\nThis is nothing new. I\u0026rsquo;ve been turned down for jobs before. Hell, I\u0026rsquo;ve done the job hunt thing on a near-annual basis, which pretty much inevitably results in at least one application rejection per cycle. I\u0026rsquo;ve had so many that I\u0026rsquo;ve dealt with such rejections at nearly every step of the process.\nThere weren\u0026rsquo;t even a lot of stakes for this job. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t looking (and was even actively not looking) when it fell into my lap. I didn\u0026rsquo;t even need the job (which changed the entire feel of the interviews even more than I anticipated).\nWould it have been a neat place to work and a good growth opportunity? Sure. Will not getting it put me in some kind of bind? Nope. I\u0026rsquo;m in probably the most financially secure position I\u0026rsquo;ve been in my entire adult life, and that was even one of the reasons I considered not pursuing the opportunity to begin with (not to mention giving me a lot of leverage when choosing to pursue it).\nHell, after not hearing anything for a couple of weeks (that was anticipated/understood), I was actually starting to kick around the idea of turning it down, because I was tired of being in limbo and just wanted to keep doing my thing, where I had no shortage of work. This bit was probably helped by the fact that a mutual connection reached out to me about a month ago and inadvertantly let it slip that \u0026ldquo;it didn\u0026rsquo;t work out\u0026rdquo; between me and the opportunity. So I knew it was very likely coming. I\u0026rsquo;d even had a fair bit of time to process through the possibility.\nAnd yet\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;when I got the typical response of \u0026ldquo;they really loved you, but decided to go with a different candidate,\u0026rdquo; it hurt. \u0026ldquo;Stung\u0026rdquo; was the word I used from the outset. Because that\u0026rsquo;s about what it felt like.\nAnd more than that, it put me into a funk for the entire rest of the afternoon and into the evening. I lost all motivation to do\u0026hellip;basically anything. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t even work up the gumption to write this until after medication, a bike ride, and couple of hours in bed playing a puzzle game. Even now, I don\u0026rsquo;t really feel like doing this, but I know I process better when I do\u0026hellip;and it\u0026rsquo;s still taking me going back to that puzzled game to \u0026ldquo;recenter\u0026rdquo; as I write this.\nI know what I\u0026rsquo;d tell me if this were one of the groups I\u0026rsquo;m a member of \u0026ndash; you\u0026rsquo;re mourning the lost opportunity and potential and that\u0026rsquo;s okay. And it is okay\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;except it\u0026rsquo;s not grief. Yeah, it was a lost opportunity and lost potential, but my disappointment about that is about the level of missing the grand prize on a carnival game, or this:\nInstead, it was the being rejected itself that got to me.\nRejection Sensitive Dysphoria I still need to write about this as its own thing, but I not-yet-officially have ADD/ADHD \u0026ndash; brought to totally dysfunctional levels by the fallout from the pandemic (for better or worse). Apparently with it (and potentially with Autism, so that\u0026rsquo;s fun, too) comes something called rejection sensitive dysphoria.\nYou know that whole \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a perfectionist\u0026rdquo; thing some people will use as a response to that \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rsquo;s your biggest flaw\u0026rdquo; BS interview question? That\u0026rsquo;s one I used to genuinely use (I am \u0026ndash; or at least used to be \u0026ndash; a perfectionist to a fault), and apparently it\u0026rsquo;s a symptom of RSD.\nNow, being a perfectionist by itself isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily indicative of RSD (though I\u0026rsquo;d venture to guess that perfectionism is indicative of something bigger going on in the vast majority of cases), but when coupled with other things like \u0026ldquo;people pleasing to avoid criticism\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;tend to assume no one likes you\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;getting overwhelmed by feeling someone is upset with you or doesn\u0026rsquo;t like you\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;have strong emotional reactions to criticism (like crying),\u0026rdquo; well\u0026hellip;\nCheck, check, check, and\u0026hellip;oh yeah, check.\nSuddenly a lot of things make sense.\nThat perfectionism was a learned response from the intersection of the high sensitivity of RSD and an emotionally abusive childhood. I had no words available to describe the level of pain I experienced (RSD wasn\u0026rsquo;t even a known thing at that time), plus getting told I\u0026rsquo;m just \u0026ldquo;thin-skinned,\u0026rdquo; meant the only real coping mechanism I had was to do everything I could to not give people reasons to criticise me \u0026ndash; to be perfect.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve always felt that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t allowed to be anything less than perfect. To this day, that\u0026rsquo;s something I still fight with. It\u0026rsquo;s honestly one of the reasons I love weight lifting and test-driven development so much \u0026ndash; they reframe \u0026ldquo;failure\u0026rdquo; to something not just not-negative (there\u0026rsquo;s no moral judgement to their messages of failure, it\u0026rsquo;s a purely mechanical \u0026ldquo;nope\u0026rdquo;), but actually positive. In both, growth and improvement happen most at the point of failure, be it at muscle failure \u0026ndash; when no amount of determination will help you lift that barbell even a fraction of an inch \u0026ndash; or at red tests identifying missing pieces that need added.\nNow What? Honestly? Fuck if I know, at least on the ADD/ADHD/RSD front. Just knowing and having the words/framework goes a super long way for me in understanding and accepting certain things, and I\u0026rsquo;ve already been going down this road of shedding that perfectionism and people-pleasing stuff, and otherwise unknowingly creating healthier coping mechanisms. I learned some time ago that my life is much more enjoyable and with much less stress if I just do my thing and if people like it, great.\nFor the work thing, it seems The Universe Has Spoken and freelancing/doing my own thing is my career path, too. I mean\u0026hellip;I am coming up on my second anniversary of being freelance, putting it in the upper echelons of my work tenures with any one arrangement, it really doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like it\u0026rsquo;s been that long, and this experience has shown me that I still want my work arrangement to be like this and I still want to keep doing what I\u0026rsquo;m doing \u0026ndash; even if that means I need to be more mindful about structuring my day better.\n","date":"Sep 4, 2020","description":"Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria. Yeah, it's a thing.","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2020/09/04/on-rejection-and-mental-health/","series":null,"subtitle":null,"tags":["community contribution","mental health","HackTheStigma"],"title":"On Rejection and Mental Health"},{"categories":["community","tech"],"contents":"The topic of changing verbiage within the tech industry, particularly as it relates to references to \u0026ldquo;master,\u0026rdquo; particularly in the \u0026ldquo;master/slave\u0026rdquo; contexts, but also in places like \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo; branch in git (which does, in fact, have its roots in the \u0026ldquo;master/slave\u0026rdquo; paradigm), came up in a couple of Slack groups in which I participate.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s certainly not new (some discussions on the matter date back a decade or more), but it\u0026rsquo;s always kind of a contentious topic when it comes up, despite the terminology getting phased out over time.\nIn this latest iteration, a young man voiced his concerns regarding the issue \u0026ndash; while he was okay with making the verbiage change, particularly when it came to git branches (which is a super easy change to make), he didn\u0026rsquo;t really understand the offense in the context (most people do assume git\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo; branch is in the \u0026ldquo;master copy\u0026rdquo; sense, which is a reasonable assumption) and felt that the context didn\u0026rsquo;t leave much \u0026ndash; if any \u0026ndash; room for offense. \u0026ldquo;It feels to me very much like manufacturing outrage,\u0026rdquo; he ended his response with.\nHe\u0026rsquo;s a good guy, but\u0026hellip; \u0026#x1f62c; it was very much a \u0026ldquo;your privilege is showing\u0026rdquo; moment. (For the record, he took my feedback, where the analogy below comes from, with grace and appreciation. It was very much a case of a privilege blind spot.) I needed a way to describe the situation in a way that he could relate to, and I came up with the following scenario:\nThe Analogy Consider this - let\u0026rsquo;s say you have a deep phobia of spiders.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s say your desk neighbor has a realistic fake spider on his desk and it\u0026rsquo;s in such a place that you always see it out of the corner of your eye as you try to work and it frequently triggers your phobia response. Because of the workplace setup, you can\u0026rsquo;t move or arrange yourself so that you don\u0026rsquo;t see the spider throughout the day.\nYour only option is to ask your deskmate to move it or put it away.\nHowever, your deskmate says \u0026ldquo;no.\u0026rdquo; He likes where it is and it\u0026rsquo;s just sitting there. It\u0026rsquo;s just a fake spider. Since he has no such phobia, this strikes him as a stupid and trivial issue that\u0026rsquo;s not even worth discussing. Even your attempts at explaining your phobia to him are ignored. He\u0026rsquo;s written you off as \u0026ldquo;overly sensitive\u0026rdquo; and maybe even tells you to \u0026ldquo;grow a thicker skin.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd maybe you\u0026rsquo;ve tried to just ignore it, but despite your best efforts, there\u0026rsquo;s that constant, low-level anxiety and stress triggered by that spider and no matter what you do, you can\u0026rsquo;t shake it.\nMaybe you ask him again, this time a bit more firmly, and now he responds that you\u0026rsquo;re just \u0026ldquo;manufacturing outrage\u0026rdquo; and over a stupid figurine! Seriously! Don\u0026rsquo;t you have bigger problems to solve?\nThis is the issue.\nEnter Contractualism? Interestingly enough, I had inadvertently stumbled upon an elementary description of what\u0026rsquo;s known in philosophy as \u0026ldquo;Contractualism.\u0026rdquo; If you\u0026rsquo;re like me and have watched The Good Place, you\u0026rsquo;re more aware of the idea than you may realize, since it\u0026rsquo;s\u0026hellip;well\u0026hellip;pretty much Eleanor\u0026rsquo;s entire philosophical North Star. There\u0026rsquo;s even an episode named after one of the most well-known books on the topic (What We Owe To Each Other).\nThe above is contractualism in action. We interact with each other via social contracts, whether we\u0026rsquo;re aware of them or not. This is essentially the heart of \u0026ldquo;offense\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; someone is offended (or harmed), because they do not agree to the social contract in effect in the given situation. This makes it a consent-based system \u0026ndash; all parties involved must agree (consent) to the contract, and agreement can be revoked at any time.\nIn the above example, the hypothetical self never consented to the spider being in eyeshot all the time and had a reasonable rejection of it (a phobia). And no, the deskmate does not have a reasonable rejection, per contractualism, although he is offended by the request:\nIn order to reasonably reject a principle, I must have some objection to it. This objection may begin with some direct harm I suffer as a result of the principle. So far, if the harm involved is pain or suffering, contractualism mirrors utilitarianism. However, the fact that a principle impacts negatively on me is not sufficient. To know whether I can reasonably reject the principle, I must also ask how it impacts on others. If a principle imposes a certain burden (b1) on me, but every alternative imposes a greater burden (b2) on someone else, then b1 does not give me a reason to reject the principle. If I am reasonable, then I withdraw my objection when I see that your reason is more pressing.\nIn this case, the greater burden is on the person with the phobia, because it causes actual, physical stress and harm. The inconvenience of moving the figurine pales in comparison to the phobia-induced stress under contractalism.\nSo What Does This Have To Do With Branch Names? In the analogy, the harm is pretty easily understood \u0026ndash; most people, even if they don\u0026rsquo;t really have phobias themselves, generally understand common phobias like arachnophobia on some sort of intellectual level at least enough to understand that it\u0026rsquo;s troublesome for the person, even if they don\u0026rsquo;t fully understand how or why.\nThe harm of various trigger words or phrases, such as the \u0026ldquo;master/slave\u0026rdquo; concept in computers, seems to generally be a lot more nebulous to people (and even moreso when the \u0026ldquo;slave\u0026rdquo; half is removed and only \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo; remains, such as the case with git). They can\u0026rsquo;t grasp the harm being done, even though it\u0026rsquo;s a drop-in substitution for the spider and the phobia in the analogy.\nThe simple truth of the matter is that the enslavement of Africans, while not a unique phenomenon (enslavement wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly unknown to humans, like\u0026hellip;ever), was arguably the most exploitative, subversive, and downright inhumane in history, and unlike the other forms, we\u0026rsquo;re still collectively dealing with the fallout. While slavery may have officially ended in the US at the end of the Civil War, that was immediately followed by numerous laws intended to keep the newly-freed slaves down, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t even a century later when the Civil Rights Era was in full swing, which itself was only about 60 years ago. The older people who marched probably had grandparents (and maybe even parents) who were originally slaves, while the younger ones are marching again in the current protests.\nThink about that \u0026ndash; some of the people that marched in the Civil Rights Era marches have been marching again the past couple of weeks.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s how recent this all was. It\u0026rsquo;s not the distant past, not for Black Americans. Those wounds are still raw, especially since they haven\u0026rsquo;t really been able to heal.\nSo having to constantly see flippant references to slavery, even in cases where it\u0026rsquo;s not even a very descriptive term for the context (which is most of them), is like little pieces of sand or salt getting into those wounds \u0026ndash; or the ever-present spider to the arachnophobic person. It keeps doing harm to a portion of the people involved, even if it seems inconsequential to another portion.\nBut It\u0026rsquo;s A Lot of Work For Something So Trivial! It\u0026rsquo;s actually not a lot of work to get started, which brings us back to the rules of contractualism \u0026ndash; our inconvenience is not sufficient to claim reasonable rejection. The harm caused by the continued presence of such phrasing, especially in the context of git repositories, is still greater than the small and short-lived burden of making the change within one\u0026rsquo;s sphere of influence. It behooves us to make the change because it\u0026rsquo;s so trivial on our end.\nAt the most basic level, it boils down to an alias, a git command, and a find-and-replace on scripts. You can change your existing \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;main\u0026rdquo; (or whatever else works for you), and Github is even already working on changing its defaults , and several other large projects are getting on board (so the whole \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s too complicated!\u0026rdquo; excuse really doesn\u0026rsquo;t fly).\nSo, let\u0026rsquo;s hold up our end of the social contract and help make software \u0026ndash; and the rest of the world \u0026ndash; more inclusive, even if it\u0026rsquo;s just a tiny bit.\n","date":"Jul 2, 2020","description":"Little changes really can have a big impact, and we really don't have an excuse not to make them if it means creating a better environment for everyone.","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2020/07/02/what-we-owe-to-each-other/","series":["Black Lives Matter"],"subtitle":"Contractualism and Social Justice in the Tech Industry, Explained With Plastic Spiders","tags":["diversity","culture","civil rights"],"title":"What We Owe To Each Other"},{"categories":["community"],"contents":"So I attended a protest the other day. It was the first time I\u0026rsquo;d been downtown since it started and I had walked there (and back) from one of the suburbs. A nearly 5 mile walk each way, with the inner-most mile or two containing a lot of plywood covering up a lot of damage.\nBut you know what stuck out to me? Two things:\nWhich places were hit. Of the places that were damaged and thus boarded up, which had murals and which had graffiti. These two things speak volumes about the situation.\nWhen people hear the term \u0026ldquo;riot,\u0026rdquo; they generally think absolute, destructive anarchy a la \u0026ldquo;The Purge.\u0026rdquo; But even MLK recognized that riots aren\u0026rsquo;t anarchy. They are the manifestation of rage, but not blind rage. As much as he spoke out against rioting, he understood its meaning and its message (emphasis mine):\nUrban riots must now be recognized as durable social phenomena. They may be deplored, but they are there and should be understood. Urban riots are a special form of violence. They are not insurrections. The rioters are not seeking to seize territory or to attain control of institutions. They are mainly intended to shock the white community. They are a distorted form of social protest. The looting which is their principal feature serves many functions. It enables the most enraged and deprived Negro to take hold of consumer goods with the ease the white man does by using his purse. Often the Negro does not even want what he takes; he wants the experience of taking. But most of all, alienated from society and knowing that this society cherishes property above people, he is shocking it by abusing property rights.\nThis message is abundantly clear right now, visible in broad daylight for anyone who is willing to take the time to read and understand it. Literally written on the walls.\nIf a group wanted to just indiscriminately destroy everything, it would be exceptionally easy to do in downtown Columbus, with its century-old churches and colleges, and its plethora of high rises with what seems like more square acres of glass than there is green space in the city. And yet, only very specific places took damage.\nThe Law School and the Art Museum sit unscathed in a moat of plywood. The iconic Trinity Episcopal Church likewise remained untouched by protestors, even as it stoically and silently witnessed the damage to the statehouse. The glass facade of PNC has a plywood shell, while a block away, the Ohio Education Association building, with all its own glass, is pristine, as is the State Teachers Retirement System building. Meanwhile, several blocks down, a real estate company\u0026rsquo;s front is nothing but plywood.\nLikewise, plywood covers random windows of equally random buildings \u0026ndash; obvious signs of crossfire damage from rubber and wooden bullets and other projectiles used by police the first few nights. (This is pretty evident in the difference in damage to the different windows when you find footage of everything before it got boarded up. Hands and random items of convenience break glass differently than rubber-coated metal.)\nThe Ohio Theatre is the one standout exception. Its entire frontage destroyed (and the answer to \u0026ldquo;who did it\u0026rdquo; remains unknown). In its place stands (for now) a large mural.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s among the largest displays of the same theme - the buildings of supportive organizations get breath-taking murals if they were damaged, while those that represent or perpetuate the racism or racist system being protested get graffiti.\n(To note: the paintings aren\u0026rsquo;t ad hoc, the store owners work with the Greater Columbus Art Council to find artists to hire, but paying local Black artists to paint murals is itself a show of support and it\u0026rsquo;s a conscious decision to hear and support the community instead of trying to retaliate.)\nHow do you know it wasn\u0026rsquo;t just luck or something about the buildings that make them more resistant to damage? It\u0026rsquo;s not like the untouched buildings have forcefields.\nThe Law School is not only known for accepting less-traditional students (meaning its student body can be more diverse), but its legal clinic provides free and low cost legal services for tenant\u0026rsquo;s rights issues, in particular \u0026ndash; a highly valuable service to BIPOC communities, given the issues they struggle with.\nTrinity Episcopal Church has been a supporter of the protests since the beginning, even serving as an aid/supply station. (They also have been ringing the bells during at least some of the marches.)\nThe Columbus Museum of Art has discount and free days/times, making its learning and experience accessible to everyone.\nConversely, companies like banks and real estate agencies embody the systemic racism of our history, through policies like redlining and the predatory lending that was a major driver of the 2008 recession.\nAnd what about the other buildings? Minority-owned businesses were destroyed, too! Yep, but not by protestors (at least not intentionally).\nThere\u0026rsquo;s this thing called \u0026ldquo;accelerationism\u0026rdquo; and it\u0026rsquo;s growing in popularity among white supremacist groups in particular. In the cases where damage and provocation weren\u0026rsquo;t done by the police themselves, there\u0026rsquo;s mounting evidence that these accelerationists are inciting violence, including the president, himself. Sometimes, they\u0026rsquo;re even one and the same.\nBut enough about them Their goal is destruction, chaos, and even civil war. They don\u0026rsquo;t deserve any more of the energy I have to give. That\u0026rsquo;s not what this is about and isn\u0026rsquo;t what the protestors stand for, and it shows in the murals and the unspoken messages they leave.\nProperty destruction is by no means right, but it is understandable. It\u0026rsquo;s shock and awe, because as MLK put it, they do it \u0026ldquo;knowing that this society cherishes property above people, he is shocking it by abusing property rights.\u0026rdquo; And the focus of recent outrage has proved Dr King right, even over half a century later, and it speaks volumes about how little has really changed in the intervening decades. We may have gotten rid of the segregated drinking fountains and bathrooms, but the underlying discrimination is still there, it\u0026rsquo;s just grown more subtle and insidious.\nTo those willing to listen and hear the message, it\u0026rsquo;s a heart-wrenching cry for change \u0026ndash; real change. It\u0026rsquo;s the collective cry of family members who had to bury loved ones who died at the hands of police, of families torn apart because racial profiling put their husbands, fathers, brothers (in particular, but also their wives, mothers, and sisters) in prison for obscene and downright inhumane lengths of time, regardless of actual guilt or innocence. It\u0026rsquo;s the ever-present fear of parents not knowing if their children will make it home from school each day, or if their house will be broken into by police and they\u0026rsquo;ll be shot in their own home.\nTo them, I say: I see you. I hear your message. I stand with you. ✊\n","date":"Jun 11, 2020","description":"I hear you, and I won't keep my voice down any longer.","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2020/06/11/a-riot-is-the-language-of-the-unheard/","series":["Black Lives Matter"],"subtitle":null,"tags":["diversity","civil rights"],"title":"A Riot Is the Language of the Unheard"},{"categories":["business","remote work"],"contents":"Among my many blog post drafts, I have a satirical piece that was originally intended to turn all the \u0026ldquo;remote working is inferior [because it\u0026rsquo;s a new thing with a learning curve]\u0026rdquo; stuff on its head.\n\u0026hellip;And then COVID-19 happened and pretty much overnight, just about everyone suddenly had to do at least some things remotely (even if work wasn\u0026rsquo;t one of them).\nSchools are all now done in distance learning format (hat-tip to all of the school staff who busted their tails to make that pivot and get students of all ages going with relatively little disruption!). Zoom, Hangouts, and all the other video conference services are flooded with new people setting up every meeting, conference, non-meeting gathering, meetup, and social time under the sun. ISPs are getting bitch-slapped for not maintaining or upgrading their last-mile lines.\nSuddenly, that satirical piece became kind of prophetic as the imagined \u0026ldquo;remote is default\u0026rdquo; scenario starts becoming more of the new normal.\nNow, I\u0026rsquo;ve been a remote worker and an advocate of work cultures that focus on results, thereby allowing the people who can be location independent to be so, for several years now. As a result, I\u0026rsquo;ve found myself in more or less a \u0026ldquo;response team member\u0026rdquo; position, where I help provide resources and be a rock for those who were just tossed into the deep end. Even in that position, and even with my experience as a remote worker, it\u0026rsquo;s been fascinating to see how things changed for me and how I\u0026rsquo;ve had to adjust, too, and it highlights just how much non-remote interaction even a 100% remote-working introvert like myself actually has.\nAs I\u0026rsquo;ve addressed in the past, there\u0026rsquo;s a common misconception that being remote means holing up in your basement or something for days on end working on whatever it is you\u0026rsquo;re working on. It harkens back to the old hacker stereotypes of the hoodied, lanky, teen or 20-something guy in a dark room with nothing but the glow of his computer monitor, surrounded by cans and bottles of Mountain Dew, Hot Pocket wrappers, and pizza boxes perhaps with a stale crust or two, furiously typing away at whatever project he\u0026rsquo;s working on, only to emerge after several days or a week, his goal accomplished.\nIf that\u0026rsquo;s how you remote, you\u0026rsquo;re doing it wrong. Well\u0026hellip;under the old normal circumstances, at least.\nThe reality for me was that I had a standing weekly lunch with some friends, a biweekly in-person D\u0026amp;D campaign, and whenever schedules and interests aligned, in-person meetups a couple of times a month, as well as the less-frequent conferences and holiday celebrations, and the ad-hoc lunches or happy hours with friends or general networking meetings. In short, I had/have a pretty vibrant social life.\nI also enjoyed my days where I was the only one at home, or it was just my husband and me, because the kiddo was off at school, or they were out doing stuff.\nAll of that shifted in an instant, which turned out to be more of shock than I had anticipated (it probably didn\u0026rsquo;t help that I now have to also make sure the kiddo is keeping up with his school work). All of a sudden, the option to meet up with friends or even the simple idea of activities like \u0026ldquo;going to the movies\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;taking the family bowling\u0026rdquo; was off the table. Hell, even things like doctors appointments and grocery shopping suddenly got a hell of a lot more complicated, and even something as simple as donating a couple of PPE items turned into several days of coordination.\nAdapting To The New Normal Despite all of that, my day-to-day life has actually started to de-stress, now that the main upheaval of active change is starting to settle down and the new routines are starting to form. And to be honest, a lot of it is really positive.\nIt helps that the weather is finally reliably improving. Here in Ohio, we\u0026rsquo;re pretty much past the point of the weather going \u0026ldquo;you know what? Just for shits and giggles, I\u0026rsquo;m going to dip us into the 10 and 20 degree Fahrenheit range (subzero for my Celsius friends) for a day or two.\u0026rdquo; It still gets chilly and in that \u0026ldquo;just a little above freezing\u0026rdquo; mark at night (and\u0026hellip;you know\u0026hellip;tornado season\u0026hellip;because Midwest), but we\u0026rsquo;re seeing more sunny days and the temperature average is creeping into the mid-50s (10+ C).\nWelcome to the northern Midwest in general.\nThis means doing things outside is an option \u0026ndash; and my son and I have been taking advantage of it. We took this opportunity to work on riding his bike without training wheels, which is a pretty big deal to him (so big of a deal, he\u0026rsquo;s practically shouting it from the rooftops). That has opened up a whole world of fun science-related YouTube channels, like Minutephysics, in which I found a spectacular demonstration of the mechanics of bicycles and how they stay up. For a logic-oriented kid like mine, this was a big key in helping him understand what can make the bike fall over and that as long as he can keep himself centered, it probably won\u0026rsquo;t, because bikes are built with quite a few features that make them try to stay upright as long as they\u0026rsquo;re moving (TIL).\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also been able to enjoy a sort of \u0026ldquo;life slowdown,\u0026rdquo; overall. Gone is the feeling of needing to do all of the things right now and the general fast pace of (sub)urban life. Between the reduced need/ability to go just about anywhere, and the benefits of manual forms of transportation, even the (local) world seems to have largely slowed and calmed down. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel so weird now to be tending to my garden in the morning or at lunch, like I\u0026rsquo;m the odd one in the area, because more people in general are getting outside to do literally anything that they can.\nRedefining Productivity One of the first things we learned as an \u0026ldquo;accidental homeshooler\u0026rdquo; family was that you really can\u0026rsquo;t do a 1:1 replication of the brick-and-mortar school day. It\u0026rsquo;s just not going to happen. The 7-hour school day is the way it is pretty much solely to play the cat-herding game that is dealing with groups of 30 kids (especially at the elementary level). When your kid can work through the content at their own pace, it will take them however long it takes them to do it. That might be 2 hours or it might be 12. And if it takes 2 hours, don\u0026rsquo;t try to pile another 5 onto them. It\u0026rsquo;s not going to turn out well.\nBesides, kids learn all the time from pretty much everything \u0026ndash; including boredom and learning to self-entertain. Having nothing to do isn\u0026rsquo;t a bad thing for a kid. That said, if you want to give them something educational to do, have a look a interest-led learning, where you give them something to do based on something they already enjoy. By doing so, you can guide them toward learning a wealth of different topics, while they have fun doing what they love. (See also: the aforementioned physics lessons from bike riding.)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also changed how I have personally approached productivity. Even while working remotely in normal circumstances, I still treated the weekdays as \u0026ldquo;time to work.\u0026rdquo; This was partially a practicality thing, because that\u0026rsquo;s when kiddo was at school and the husband was also working. Outside of the \u0026ldquo;normal business hours,\u0026rdquo; the house activity reached a point where I could no longer work very well. Likewise, \u0026ldquo;work\u0026rdquo; frequently translated to \u0026ldquo;the stuff that gets me paid either now or at some point in the future,\u0026rdquo; and I actively tried to ensure I clocked 6 hours of \u0026ldquo;productive\u0026rdquo; time each day. (Yes, 6 and not 8, because that\u0026rsquo;s actually what most knowledge/office workers actually work on \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; work. The other two generally consists of watercooler chat, refocusing from interruptions, small breaks, and general presenteeism for various reasons, among other things.)\nSurprisingly, that had to change, too, and interestingly, it seems to have brought my actual habits, goals, etc more in line with my ideals about how work is supposed to work and how productivity for a high-tech worker like myself actually works.\nThe stressors of the pandemic, plus a number of stressors in my own life that predate it, have left me running pretty much at a max of half mana for the better part of the past six months or so and really screwed with my executive functioning\u0026hellip;and ultimately shining a giant spotlight on the fact that I apparently have ADD (not the hyperactive kind, the good old fashioned \u0026ldquo;can\u0026rsquo;t stay focused for shit\u0026rdquo; kind; I\u0026rsquo;ll get into the details on that in another post at some point). Combined, everything has forced me to revamp\u0026hellip;well\u0026hellip;my entire day life.\nMost people probably won\u0026rsquo;t have to go to that kind of extreme, but most of the changes have revolved around redefining what \u0026ldquo;productivity\u0026rdquo; actually looks like.\nHint: it\u0026rsquo;s not \u0026ldquo;spend 6 hours every week day working for pay\u0026rdquo; anymore.\nInstead, I\u0026rsquo;m using the MakeTime calendar template to outline my \u0026ldquo;ideal\u0026rdquo; day (what I\u0026rsquo;d like to do with different blocks of time). While the general idea of the blocks is pretty much the same as what I\u0026rsquo;m already doing, the afternoon options are just as much \u0026ldquo;do something not related to coding\u0026rdquo; (which includes doing my adjunct work or helping kiddo with his work or even doing my own professional development) as they are \u0026ldquo;do more coding,\u0026rdquo; because my mornings seem to be the best time for deep coding work, generally. Things like teaching kiddo to ride a bike, or tending to my garden also count (because health and food), as does doing the household finances.\nIn short, \u0026ldquo;productivity\u0026rdquo; is no longer just about currency, but what I can do to keep life in general running. And some days, that means doing things that aren\u0026rsquo;t tied to a paycheck of some sort, and that\u0026rsquo;s okay.\nBut I Need All Those Hours To Get Paycheck Work Done! Are you sure about that? Like, really, really sure? Because research and Parkinson\u0026rsquo;s Law state otherwise.\nTry it. Focus less on filling X number of hours and instead create time boxes and focus on what you can get done in that particular time block. Pomodoro type timers work great for jumping into this.\nIf you do it for a week or two and still need all the extra hours and the \u0026ldquo;extra\u0026rdquo; work isn\u0026rsquo;t from other extenuating circumstances, then you can go back to it (though you may also want to consider whether your workload is reasonable for your position in general; most people don\u0026rsquo;t actually fill the standard 8ish hour day with \u0026ldquo;productive\u0026rdquo; work). No harm, no foul.\nGetting Creative As I\u0026rsquo;m writing this, I\u0026rsquo;m sitting in one of my (now three) hammocks, which I strung up to the rafters of my covered porch. It provides me with a change of scenery when my office walls start to proverbially close in on me from the sheer amount of time I spend in it. It also lets me enjoy this nicer weather, even while I\u0026rsquo;m working.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also been working on my garden, which was something I planned long before all this, but I adapted when things started changing. I had started a number of plants from seed using the usual method of \u0026ldquo;plant a few in each spot and thin later.\u0026rdquo; Normally, \u0026ldquo;thinning\u0026rdquo; generally assumes that you discard the plants that don\u0026rsquo;t look as hardy, but that would have been a lot of plants wasted in a time of uncertainty.\nScrew that. I\u0026rsquo;ll take an extra bushel or three of tomatoes if it means that much less of a food supply chain I have to worry about it. (The perks of having grown up in the Appalachian region \u0026ndash; canning and dehydrating and whatnot are things I can fall back on without a second thought.)\nBut\u0026hellip;that did mean I needed more peat pots for all these sprouts. Thankfully, Lowe\u0026rsquo;s still had them, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t have the containers to put them in to keep them from drying out too quickly (or to keep water from going everywhere), and I had already used the spare one I had picked up earlier. Welp\u0026hellip;guess I\u0026rsquo;m using the lid of the kit I had started with.\n\u0026hellip;And the Rubbermaid containers I happen to have nearby, so I can get the new set of pots up to the grow light.\n","date":"May 3, 2020","description":"These are not normal remote working circumstances.","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2020/05/03/adventures-in-a-remote-world/","series":null,"subtitle":null,"tags":["remote","covid"],"title":"Adventures In A Remote World"},{"categories":["business","remote work"],"contents":" Some Notes:\nContrary to most of my other posts, I plan to update this one periodically as things change and this is still current. Check back periodically for updates.\nAre you a business owner or manager? Have a look at Remotewave.io\u0026rsquo;s guide, which approaches it from your side. :)\nWell\u0026hellip;now that half the world is in quarantine of some level, a great many people are suddenly finding themselves tossed head first in the deep end of remote working. Odds are pretty good neither them nor their employers are really prepared for this.\nWhile I can\u0026rsquo;t help the employer\u0026rsquo;s preparation (or lack thereof), I do know a thing or two about being a remote worker and figured I would share my experience. Since for a lot of people, this is a temporary situation, I\u0026rsquo;ll discuss both more permanent setups and temporary improvised setups when they diverge. You never know, you may like this whole \u0026ldquo;working from home\u0026rdquo; thing, even if not full time. :)\nEnvironment Your Office Spot A lot of people think that \u0026ldquo;working from home\u0026rdquo; equates to working in bed, on the couch, at the breakfast bar, or whatever. While these aren\u0026rsquo;t bad places for a change of pace, it\u0026rsquo;s still good to have a \u0026ldquo;home base\u0026rdquo; for yourself. This does a few things:\nHelps you get into the \u0026ldquo;headspace\u0026rdquo; for work. You go to this spot to work, not play or watch TV or whatever. Helps other members of your house see that you\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;at work.\u0026rdquo; When you\u0026rsquo;re in this spot, you\u0026rsquo;re not free to do errands or chores. (You will still have to train them, though.) Permanent setup: Long term remoters will usually have a dedicated home office with a door, or at least a space separated by large furniture like bookshelves that provide a solid visual differentiation of their office space from the surrounding environment.\nImprovising: If you don\u0026rsquo;t plan to or won\u0026rsquo;t be able to work from home in the long term, clearing out a room or buying extra furniture doesn\u0026rsquo;t make much sense, but you can repurpose either or both for the time being. A guest bedroom makes for a good office space, for example (or at least conference room), or if you can move your couch, you can create a work area within your living room with the couch as a \u0026ldquo;wall.\u0026rdquo;\nOffice Furniture Like the office space, the furniture still needs to be conducive to working in for long stretches of time.\nPermanent setup: If you\u0026rsquo;re in this for the long haul, it\u0026rsquo;s worth investing in a good desk and high-quality chair. I\u0026rsquo;m a fan of convertible sit-stand desks (like the Jarvis) and the higher-end gaming chairs (like AK Racing). Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to spend some money on these. Your back will thank you.\nImprovising: Commandeer your gaming chair if you have one. If you don\u0026rsquo;t, scope out a variety of chairs and tables you can rotate through every couple of hours. A dining room table is a decent height for a while when alternated with standing at the breakfast bar.\nHacking: Maybe even the improvisation isn\u0026rsquo;t feasible for you. If that\u0026rsquo;s the case, take a field trip over to Ikea (ideally in store, but online should work, too) and get a cheap, but comfortable desk and chair. They should be good enough for the time being, and Ikea has a 1-year, no questions asked return policy. Just make sure to keep the receipt. (I don\u0026rsquo;t normally condone \u0026ldquo;leasing\u0026rdquo; like this, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do.) Alternatively, pick up something that you can use as a desk for now and repurpose later on (the Omar wire shelving is cheap, adjustable, and about the right height for a laptop desk if you only put one or two of the shelves on).\nLighting and Sound Good lighting and attention to ambient noise is also crucial for any work environment. Natural lighting is some of the best, especially if it can be diffused, but a good lamp or overhead light can also work.\nA dedicated room \u0026ndash; whether it\u0026rsquo;s permanent or temporary \u0026ndash; will likely get both of these for \u0026ldquo;free.\u0026rdquo;\nFor those that can\u0026rsquo;t dedicate a room, try to pick one with carpet or other sound-dampening features and a decent sized window or good overhead light. If you have other people in the house, you\u0026rsquo;ll also want to bring home your noise cancelling headphones.\nThe Workday Working from home can have some pitfalls if you\u0026rsquo;re not careful. One of them is the falling apart of routine, especially if you can\u0026rsquo;t have a dedicated work space.\nKeep Your Morning Routine Even though you\u0026rsquo;re not driving into work, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to keep your morning routine so that you can get into the right \u0026ldquo;headspace\u0026rdquo; for working. Keep your alarm set, get up, have breakfast or your morning coffee, get a shower, get dressed, etc.\nWhat you do with the extra time you\u0026rsquo;d have normally burned during your commute is up to you, but here are a couple of ideas:\nSpend some time with your spouse, kid(s), and/or pet(s). Dedicate that time to your own self-improvement in some way, such as reading a book, doing yoga, or taking a morning walk. Start your work day earlier so you can lengthen your lunch break, take more breaks throughout the day, and/or end your day earlier. Farm a highly-contested spot in your favorite MMO game. Prioritize One-On-Ones If your company doesn\u0026rsquo;t have them already, now might be a good time to try to introduce one-on-one meetings between managers and their reports. If your company already has them, be sure to keep them going. Now is more important than ever to have a high level of open communication with those who you report to and who report to you, especially since the social distancing right now increases the chance of people feeling isolated and out of touch (especially the more extraverted members of your team).\nPrioritize Communication In General In a remote environment, communication and socialization are not givens like they often are in the office. You have to make a point to talk to your co-workers, especially with regard to the \u0026ldquo;watercooler\u0026rdquo; chat. If you have a work buddy that you often chat or go to lunch with, make a point to keep up that routine in some way. This could be checking in via chat or email, or setting up a video conference or phone call. Maybe put each other on speakerphone while you make your respective lunches.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s seriously no such thing as overcommunication in a remote environment.\nTip: Standups Agile companies often do daily standups, but given the turmoil, it might be difficult for them to maintain them in the traditional fashion. If your company stops doing them \u0026ndash; or if they never did them to begin with \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to post a quick thing in your company\u0026rsquo;s text chat. This will help you get into the habit of \u0026ldquo;over\u0026rdquo; communicating and help keep your team informed about what you\u0026rsquo;re working on and any blockers you might have.\nMy format for it generally takes the form of \u0026ldquo;what I did yesterday, what I plan for today, what blockers I have\u0026rdquo; to give me something like:\nYesterday: Got the e-commerce widget doing the thing! \\o/ Also started on the cart thing and took a look at the media widget bug. That bug appears to be more than just a code issue, so I talked to Joe about it and he\u0026rsquo;s going to take a look at it on the media end.\nToday: I should be able to finish the cart thing today, barring any unforeseen hurdles. If I have time, then it\u0026rsquo;s on to the slider.\nBlockers: Nothing completely blocking me, but I know Joe\u0026rsquo;s got a lot on his plate, so I don\u0026rsquo;t know if he\u0026rsquo;s going to be able to get back to me on the media widget bug in time for it to get fixed by the end of the sprint.\nWork On Tasks In Parallel In an office, you might have been able to stop what you\u0026rsquo;re doing, walk over to a coworker, and ask them a question if you\u0026rsquo;re stuck. Since your presence pretty much demands their attention, you usually probably got unstuck by such an interaction.\nBut in a remote environment, you trade that luxury on your end for the luxury of the \u0026ldquo;do not disturb\u0026rdquo; setting on their end. No longer are you guaranteed they\u0026rsquo;ll respond to your question or help you get unstuck. That leaves you with a couple of other routes: either get yourself unstuck on that task, or switch tasks until you hear back from the person from whom you need help.\nTip: Embrace The Asynchronicity I\u0026rsquo;ve found it helpful to take a moment to look at what needs done, especially the things that are coming up soon, but I\u0026rsquo;m not actively working on right now, and gathering any questions or concerns I have \u0026ndash; anything that requires talking with someone else \u0026ndash; and sending those over to them, letting them know that I\u0026rsquo;ll be working on it soon, after these things are squared away. By doing this, I can get something that was in a questionable state into a workable state before I get to that item, so I can just jump straight into my work for it.\nTools Your options might be limited to what the company will provide, but there are a number of tools available to make remote working a lot easier and mitigate a lot of the complaints people often have about remote working. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have these, it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to advocate for them in your company. Many also have specials going on right now to help with the fallout from this pandemic. If you have a similar tool that\u0026rsquo;s a different brand, you might still be able to leverage some of the additional perks of it. Look into your company products to see what might help your team.\nGeneral Chat - Text Tools A text chat tool is pretty much a must-have for a remote team. Slack and Discord are common ones that are very quick and easy to set up in a pinch, while Microsoft Teams is a good option for companies already heavily invested in Microsoft. Basecamp and Notion are more holistic options that are worth considering if the company wants to make longer term changes from this experience.\nThese kinds of chat tools allow for more flexible communication cadences, because they can be either synchronous (voice chat options, or just faster text messaging back and forth), or asynchronous (leave messages for a person that they can answer when they free up), and are generally the communication platform of choice for a remote organization.\nVoice And Video Chat Sometimes, a voice or video conference is what\u0026rsquo;s needed (or even just wanted, which is okay, too). Slack, Teams, and Discord all have built-in voice chat options, either in the call or the conference paradigms, and (the latter two, at least) can support screen sharing.\nFor dedicated video chat, Zoom is one of my favorites, though Google Meet is another option, especially if you have a Google Apps Business account (the free leaves a fair bit to be desired, but business level is better). Some people also favor Webex and there are several more available, too.\nTip: Noise Filtering If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a good headset with noise filtering, especially on the mic, consider software noise filtering like Krisp. They\u0026rsquo;re generally free (or have a long enough trial to get you through this time).\nTime Management A common complaint of remote newcomers is the blurring of work and home time, because without the commute and the cues from coworkers coming and going, you don\u0026rsquo;t have that very distinct switch, and it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get focused on work such that you lose track of time entirely. The always-connected nature of remote tools also makes it easy to work more than you ever would in an office.\nPomodoro timers, alarm clocks, or any similar tools are useful both for focusing and for stepping away. They give you the cues needed to take a break or get back to work. I\u0026rsquo;ve personally been using a Mac app called Flow, which is simple, free, and open source.\nAlso, put your work hours on your calendar and stick to them. When it\u0026rsquo;s time to stop, walk away. Put your work down and leave it until tomorrow. \u0026ldquo;Go home\u0026rdquo; just like you would if you were at the office.\nTemporary Remoters: Don\u0026rsquo;t put your email or text chat on your phone if you didn\u0026rsquo;t already have it. Don\u0026rsquo;t set the precedent that you\u0026rsquo;re working 24/7. Having it also makes it harder to separate \u0026ldquo;work time\u0026rdquo; from \u0026ldquo;home time.\u0026rdquo;\nAlso, because this is an extenuating circumstance issue \u0026ndash; and if you have kids, they\u0026rsquo;re probably home, too \u0026ndash; consider adjusting your work hours (and expectations). Kids are disruptive, and after three weeks of being stuck at home, they\u0026rsquo;re likely to go stir crazy. Break up your day if you have to and tag-team with any other adults in your household for things like meetings. For individual work, if they\u0026rsquo;re disrupting you too much, take a break from work and come back to it when they\u0026rsquo;re occupied or sleeping. These breaks are great times to do basic home things like dishes or laundry.\nTask Management Hopefully you already have digital tools for task management, but if you need to convert your Kanban board made of actual Post-It notes, there are a bunch of options these days. Trello is probably the best for a straight Kanban conversion, given its card-by-default paradigm. Asana is a common option for straight to-do lists (it can technically support more complex project management, but I\u0026rsquo;m not keen on recommending it for that), and I\u0026rsquo;ve been a longtime fan of Any.do for basic to-do lists, especially with recurring tasks and mobile-heavy usage. For a combination of both to-do style lists and Kanban style boards, I\u0026rsquo;ve become a recent convert of ClickUp* \u0026ndash; tons of power in a user-friendly package. Any will work, and all have free options, so it\u0026rsquo;s a particularly great solution for the temporary remoters.\n* A rare affiliate link, because that\u0026rsquo;s how much I already love it.\nSanity Saving As of yesterday, my state has even shut down bars and the dine-in portion of restaurants, and the public library and local zoo already announced their own closures. Combined with the likely closures of other non-essential establishments, this means we\u0026rsquo;re pretty much stuck at home. So how do we keep from going totally stir crazy?\nWork Outside For A Bit If there\u0026rsquo;s anything we learned from past pandemics, it\u0026rsquo;s that some sun and ample amounts of fresh air help. And really, those things help keep us healthy even when we\u0026rsquo;re not sick.\nIf you can, take your work outside for an hour or three. If you can\u0026rsquo;t go outside, try opening the windows to get some fresh air. Weather permitting, of course.\nIf Your Area Permits, Go For A Walk Or Bike Ride I originally had a section in here about this, but I ended up removing it for the initial release, because I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to propagate irresponsible behavior and I didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough confirmation of the safety of doing this. It was tough, because walking and bike riding, as well as being outside (even in cooler weather), can help support the body both in preventing getting sick and in mitigating the risk of complications if you do get sick with COVID-19.\nThen I found this article on safe cycling during coronavirus concerns, which goes into more detail about how to ride safely and where the hidden risks are. In short, rides and walks are good as long as you stay 6+ feet away from others, generally avoid touching stuff (or use gloves), and wash up as soon as you can. If you use bike shares, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hurt to bring sanitizing wipes with you to use on them.\nIf you can\u0026rsquo;t leave your property, but have even a tiny yard, consider some outdoor yoga or training of some sort. Anything to get you outside and keeping your body healthy will help.\nTake Some \u0026ldquo;Me\u0026rdquo; Time Even if this is something you don\u0026rsquo;t normally do, you\u0026rsquo;re going to get tired of seeing the same couple of people day in and day out. Set aside a bit of time each day for everyone to do their own thing in their own space. It can be as simple as reading a book or playing a video game or whatever. The point is to get away from your housemates for a bit and into your own space.\nSocialize Conversely, we\u0026rsquo;re still social creatures and need socialization. Play some board games with members of your household or just chat with each other, maybe a little more than you normally would.\nAlso, make a point to check in with your friends via text or phone or whatever your preferred communication channel is. Not only is it good for staving off cabin fever, but it can be helpful for keeping an eye on friends who live alone or otherwise having the chance to support someone in need of help.\nLearn Something New Now\u0026rsquo;s a pretty good time to take up that new hobby you\u0026rsquo;ve been kicking around. Or maybe you wanted to learn to bake your own bread. Since you\u0026rsquo;re going to be holed up in the house anyway, might as well make use of it, right?\nOr, Work On That Project You\u0026rsquo;ve Been Putting Off Got that knitting/crochet project you started in December, but never got back around to? Or how about that book you\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to write?\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have much of an excuse anymore! Now\u0026rsquo;s a good time to make progress and maybe even finish it.\nEmbrace The Family Interruptions And Tweak Your Schedule Accordingly While setting boundaries and times is crucial in general, this is still a time of \u0026ldquo;extenuating circumstances.\u0026rdquo; If you have kids, they\u0026rsquo;re just as likely to go stir crazy from staring at the same four walls all day every day for weeks on end. If they\u0026rsquo;re getting too disruptive for you to work, use that time to take a break for a bit if you at all can. Work can wait (this is such an important mantra to the Basecamp folks, that they even have that as a built-in feature to their platform), and you\u0026rsquo;re not going to be working well if you\u0026rsquo;re stressed from getting pulled in multiple directions. Take a bit of time to give them some attention and maybe do something a little different (even if it\u0026rsquo;s loading the dishwasher) and then go back to your work. You\u0026rsquo;ll be a bit more refreshed, less stressed, and probably more productive.\nYou Can Swim There\u0026rsquo;s a learning curve to remote working even in the best of times, and this certainly doesn\u0026rsquo;t qualify as \u0026ldquo;the best of times\u0026rdquo; to have to scale such a learning curve. However, with the above tips and tools, you\u0026rsquo;ll be better equipped to do so.\nThis is just the beginning, though. So to close out, I\u0026rsquo;ll leave you with a list of other resources for specific remote and pandemic-driven-remote related topics.\nAlso, Even Us Pros Are Struggling Right Now Take things in stride and as things start settling out into whatever \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; is for us over the next few months, the remote working will also come easier. You\u0026rsquo;re dealing with the remote working learning curve and a global pandemic with little information and (if you have kids) remote schooling and have to limit the amount of \u0026ldquo;getting away\u0026rdquo; you can do. Even 25% productivity at work right now is pretty good.\nAdditional Resources General Remote Resources Remote Communication - An article I wrote for Gun.io that focuses on communicating while remote.

I ended up scrapping it when life rendered it completely wrong almost as soon as I\u0026rsquo;d finished writing it. \u0026#x1f926;\nRemember in part 3, where I mentioned that I got my windows replaced?\nApparently such investments have side-effects\u0026hellip;\nMaybe I Should Start A Lemon Orchard \u0026hellip;Like frying the HVAC system, because it\u0026rsquo;s oversized for the house, when said house is properly insulated. Nothing like spending a hot, rainy summer in a house with crap natural airflow, without air conditioning.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, I\u0026rsquo;m not the type to turn on the AC the moment it hits 70F. I grew up in houses built in the late 19th and early 20th century, when electricity may or may not have been a thing, and air conditioning sure as hell wasn\u0026rsquo;t. But here\u0026rsquo;s the thing: houses built then were designed for airflow. Houses built in the 60s (and apparently with the idea that air conditioning will always be a thing and never fail for any reason whatsoever)? \u0026hellip;not so much. It turns out, those giant wrap-around porches on Victorian houses serve a vital purpose to the livability of the inside.\nOh, and this happened after a leak in our upstairs bathroom destroyed our downstairs one (this poor downstairs bathroom, this is now the second time it\u0026rsquo;s been ruined and redone due to leaks upstairs since we moved in; yay, wet walls :sad_trombone: ) and we subsequently remodeled the upstairs one (the expensive part being the bathtub area, which was the primary leak).\nAnd both mine and my husband\u0026rsquo;s health decided to go such that required medical help (and in my case, expensive supplements) to correct, lest we be reduced to blobs in the bed with no energy to do anything at all, except sleep all day. (The lesson here, kids, is to always make sure your Vitamin D and B12 levels are where they should be, lest they fuck up ev-er-y-thing.)\nOh, and all this happened after a string of bad luck with regard to employment for me, resulting in me working for only about a third of this year. I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to nearly double my hourly rate (as W2), though, so that\u0026rsquo;s helped during the times I\u0026rsquo;ve been working.\nBut what\u0026rsquo;s that mean for my financial plan? Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the inputs.\nWelcome To The 21st Century Employment Climate It all started back in February, when I\u0026rsquo;d reached my breaking point with the company I was working at. For reasons I\u0026rsquo;m not at liberty to discuss, my tenure there ended. Before I left, though, I learned about a fun little resource called Payscale and found out what I should actually be making. (\u0026ldquo;Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Glassdoor do the same?\u0026rdquo; More or less, but I\u0026rsquo;ve found Payscale to be more refined and accurate toward what I should be making, as opposed to just how a handful of companies pay, and it illustrates things like gender pay gaps for a given title, not just in general, but by years of experience. Using them both together might not be a bad idea, though.)\nSuffice it to say, I was way, way underpaid, even more than I already knew, and especially now that I\u0026rsquo;d officially acquired the title of Senior Software Engineer. Nothing like getting a raise that amounts to the income level of some households (even if it requires changing jobs)\n\u0026hellip;if I could get (and keep) another job.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s where it\u0026rsquo;s been hard, because apparently in the time I spent at my last job getting that title, the local market decided to make a hard shift toward languages/frameworks I don\u0026rsquo;t particularly care for. The language I\u0026rsquo;ve spent the better part of the past decade mastering has suddenly dropped off the face of the earth around here, at best relegated to the horrendously underpaying and exploitative industry of marketing agencies.\nSo\u0026hellip;it\u0026rsquo;s either hold out for a job in my skillset, or sweet-talk my way into a job while learning a new stack on the fly. In both cases, getting to the offer takes time and can be fairly high risk. As it turns out, I\u0026rsquo;ve had the \u0026ldquo;opportunity\u0026rdquo; to do both.\nThe first opportunity was the \u0026ldquo;new stack\u0026rdquo; variety. The upside is that I got a bit more Ruby under my belt. The downsides were that a) I found I really don\u0026rsquo;t like Rails, and b) the boss saying one thing and expecting another is a recipe for disaster for me and something I have zero tolerance for (for the sake of my sanity).\nThe second was finding that increasingly rare job in my skillset. It was a pretty sweet gig, too. Got to teach a junior dev stuff, my coworkers were great, I could basically set my own hours and got to toy around with a reduced-hour workweek (only downside there being I was paid hourly, so took the pay \u0026ldquo;cut\u0026rdquo; accordingly, but the hourly rate was such that the reduced hours resulted in an aggregate pay equal to my last job, so it was a good opportunity to try it). It was an exciting project, too. Things were going great\u0026hellip;until they came to a screeching halt. I still have no idea what happened there, beyond one day finding myself again unemployed (and this, kids, is one of the many dark sides of \u0026ldquo;employment at will\u0026rdquo; laws and the culture of technically-not-defacto-employees contract arrangements the tech industry loves).\nLike I\u0026rsquo;ve said before, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to pay off a bunch of debt when life is going swimmingly and you can maintain the status quo of everything for years on end. It\u0026rsquo;s not so easy when life decides to slap you in the face every couple of months.\nWhy Not Just Get Any Job In The Meantime? I know what you might be thinking - just get a service or retail or [insert gig here] job until I can land a \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; job. I\u0026rsquo;ve thought about that, and it\u0026rsquo;s certainly something to consider, generally speaking. However, at my level, it\u0026rsquo;s actually not that simple. I\u0026rsquo;ve got a Bachelor of Science degree, Master\u0026rsquo;s in business, and a significant level of experience under my belt in a lucrative industry experiencing a skill shortage. In short, I\u0026rsquo;m overqualified as hell, which means I very likely wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even be able to get one of those jobs, because they know that I\u0026rsquo;ll be leaving as soon as I find something that actually matches my skillset. I can\u0026rsquo;t really blame them.\nThen, there\u0026rsquo;s the whole thing with having time for interviews and whatnot. I\u0026rsquo;ve worked retail before. \u0026ldquo;Part time\u0026rdquo; means 31.5 hours a week (because 32 makes you \u0026ldquo;full time\u0026rdquo; and eligible for benefits), with whatever hours they need you and you might get 1-2 week\u0026rsquo;s notice. That makes it very difficult to arrange interviews, actually making it harder to get back to where I was (especially now that we\u0026rsquo;re getting into the holiday season, and especially considering my industry\u0026rsquo;s love of \u0026ldquo;code days\u0026rdquo; or similar tactics to try to better gauge fit).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s still something to consider, but it\u0026rsquo;s not really feasible or ideal if I\u0026rsquo;ve still got other options available to me, especially when it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to tell for how long I\u0026rsquo;d actually need to be looking for the next job. Also, at it happens, while I was in the process of writing this, I landed a sort of freelance-style gig that should have full time-ish hours (and I can again leverage reduced hours with a higher hourly rate to work on passive income projects).\nIf it\u0026rsquo;s not obvious at this point, my decisions may not seem intuitive or with the conventional wisdom of\u0026hellip;well\u0026hellip;anything or anyone, but there\u0026rsquo;s a method to my madness. Some of them do carry some risk, though, so be sure to consider your own circumstances if/when you\u0026rsquo;re in a similar situation.\nBorrowing Money To Save Money So, we found ourselves in a situation where things needed fixed, but we couldn\u0026rsquo;t take on any more (unsecured) debt. Even if the banks would let us, making the monthly payments would be challenging until I got working again. And that\u0026rsquo;s really what was killing us - the monthly payments from the number of different sources. The bathtub job required two separate loans to pull off, which increases the total amount paid. None of our accounts, except for the one credit card we hadn\u0026rsquo;t paid off yet*, had particularly high interest rates, so even being able to pay a few dollars over the minimum would have made substantial headway over time, but that requires enough money to make the monthly payments to begin with.\n* We were actually doing very well with getting it paid off, which was supremely frustrating. I had managed to get it nearly halfway down \u0026ndash; from maxed out \u0026ndash; by the time all this started happening. It still had several thousand dollars left on it (largely thanks to the interest rate), but I had been on track to pay it off somewhere around early 2019 had I been working the entire year.\nHowever, we needed to fix the HVAC system. While we could (more or less) live without the AC, we knew the furnace wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be far behind (they were put in at the same time and suffered from that same fatal flaw of being oversized), and this is Ohio. To go without heat in winter here is bordering on a death wish (not to mention a recipe for plumbing disaster). I\u0026rsquo;ll take financial debt interest over structural debt interest any day. The last thing we needed was to have the furnace go out in January, given how quickly the weather\u0026rsquo;s already turned cold.\nThere was only one problem \u0026ndash; the banks wouldn\u0026rsquo;t give us any more money. Fair enough. Our debt to income ratio sucked at the time, and now my work history has been blown to smithereens. Yeah, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t lend to me, either.\nThere is another option, though \u0026ndash; a secured loan. Specifically, cashing in on the increased value of our house with a Home Equity Line of Credit (or HELOC). Situations like this make this the biggest benefit to owning one\u0026rsquo;s own house. It\u0026rsquo;s still a loan, which sucks, and is basically a mortgage in its own right, so it\u0026rsquo;s definitely something to tread carefully with, but it can be useful if handled correctly.\nFull disclosure: I really don\u0026rsquo;t like having to continue borrowing money. I seriously hate it. If it were up to me, I\u0026rsquo;d get everything paid off and start working exclusively in cash. When both my husband and I are working, there is really no reason we can\u0026rsquo;t do that. So I can\u0026rsquo;t emphasize enough just how seriously I\u0026rsquo;ve taken having to borrow yet more money, especially via the equity of my house. I just keep seeing that timeline to getting everything paid off stretch farther and farther into the future, and I don\u0026rsquo;t like it.\nBut\u0026hellip;going this route for our situation actually decreased the amount of money going out on a monthly basis, because we treated it basically as a loan consolidation. See, the nice thing about secured loans is that their interest rate tends to be lower and you can usually get your hands on more money, which means they can usually pay off several of your unsecured loans.\nBye bye high interest credit card.\nAs an aside, I just want to mention how ridiculously hard it is to find a good gif of N\u0026rsquo;Sync doing that signature move as the puppets.\nAlso, bye bye one of the loans from the bathroom, and \u0026ndash; after some more time paying it down during one of my employed stints \u0026ndash; the car loan.\nWait\u0026hellip;Wasn\u0026rsquo;t The Car 0% Interest? Astute readers may remember that my car had (I kid you not) a 0% interest rate on it. So why would I pay that off, instead of one of the other debts that had interest on it?\nIt (almost) all comes down to the monthly payments.\nWhile the general debt payoff systems have the goal of paying as absolutely little amount of interest as possible over the life of the loans, which saves money in the long run, my priority right now is to keep the monthly expenses as low as possible. Prioritizing a lower-payment loan because it has higher interest doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense if doing so still leaves me a couple hundred dollars a month short of paying the other stuff. That zero-interest deal came with a monthly price tag of nearly double everything else.\nIt was also a lower balance than the other debts, allowing me to pay it off where I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have quite been able to with the others, and would have required two other loans paid off to get the same monthly amount back.\nThat also means that I now officially own my car outright. :happy_dance: (Okay, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s a technicality, since I did use borrowed cash to pay it, but as far as the dealership, bank, and DMV are concerned, it\u0026rsquo;s entirely mine, and that\u0026rsquo;s a nice feeling in a year of disappointments like this one.)\nAny who\u0026hellip;where were we?\nThe Next Year So! Now that we\u0026rsquo;ve looked at this past year, let\u0026rsquo;s look at what\u0026rsquo;s ahead. Here\u0026rsquo;s hoping for an uneventful year and everything on track. I could use it.\nGoal 1: Home Improvement Stuff Unfortunately, our bathroom wasn\u0026rsquo;t the only leaky thing. Our gutters were rather poorly designed, and part of the top section of roof drains right onto the roof of our back deck. This was\u0026hellip;okay\u0026hellip;until all of that water (like 500 square feet of water from the top roof, times however many years of above-average precipitation) basically eroded the roof away and had destroyed that section of deck roof, and the rest of the deck roof isn\u0026rsquo;t far behind. Heaven forbid we ever need to climb out of the windows over it for any reason, too.\nThat, among other things, has resulted in a collection of water near the foundation when it rains, to the point that there\u0026rsquo;s a spot that leaks like a small river. That\u0026rsquo;s very, very bad. (Our saving grace on the overall damage front is that the worst in the unfinished part of the basement, so it leaks onto concrete and flows to the drain, but even that\u0026rsquo;s still on the backside of drywall that I\u0026rsquo;m not convinced is wet area rated.)\nSo, we plan to redo that segment. Our plan is to replace the back deck with one that comes out of the top level of our house (this also has the added safety benefit of an escape route from the top floor of our split level that doesn\u0026rsquo;t require attempting to climb out of a window, and improving the safety of exiting from a couple of the other windows). Ideally, we\u0026rsquo;d like to do that this spring or summer, which is doable via the HELOC, provided I can keep working.\nI also plan on doing some landscaping, which includes a fair bit of water diversion from the back of the house to the front yard (and away from the foundation), where a bunch of thirsty plants will await to soak it all up. That\u0026rsquo;s going to be a lot of \u0026ldquo;sweat equity,\u0026rdquo; though.\nSo Much For Not Liking To Borrow Money\u0026hellip; I know. :(\nI really don\u0026rsquo;t, but it comes down to a choice between:\nNot doing anything and have things continue to degrade. Doing a stop-gap thing (in this case, only re-run the gutters to bypass the gutter part of the problem) and hope things don\u0026rsquo;t continue to degrade (which they will, because this wouldn\u0026rsquo;t include solving the issue of the falling-apart deck roof, the air patterns of that section that lead to the drain getting blocked, the probably-improper grading of the yard that doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow for proper drainage away from the house, and so on). Going big and redoing the deck and attached gutters to fix most of the problems entirely (which would fix a number of the other issues by virtue of the deck job). Or, as I see it: spend nothing now and very likely spend more later to fix the broken stuff; spend some money now and still very likely spend more later to fix things anyway; or spend a good chunk of money now to improve the status quo and not have to worry about it anymore (also, lifetime warranties are a beautiful thing).\nThankfully, as long as I can clock a decent amount of hours at this new gig, I should be able to easily pay off a fair bit more of the HELOC than what I\u0026rsquo;ll actually need to do this.\nGoal 2: Debt Paydown (\u0026hellip;Again? Still?) As always, my long term goal is to still get these damned debts paid off. The addition of the HELOC and what it would take to do more for the house than just keeping things limping along does complicate things a tiny bit, but not much.\nSee, as long as both my husband and I are working, we make bank. After all, I\u0026rsquo;ve trimmed down our expenses to the point that we can live off his income almost indefinitely. So, when I make\u0026hellip;basically anything\u0026hellip;I can use all of that money for quality of life improvements. This means that I should have the HELOC paid down enough to pay for the deck in just a couple of months, provided I get the full time (or near full time) hours promised by this new gig.\nOnce I get that allocated, it does leave a bit of a conundrum: do I continue to pay down/off the HELOC so that we have the money to do the rest of the renovations/improvements/fixes that we want to do, while we still have it available to us?* Or, do I get only what we need for the deck, plus probably a little extra to cover unforeseen expenses, and then switch back to the other debts?\n*A note about HELOCs: HELOCs are a bit special in how they work, because you have a revolving line of credit for the first ten years that the account is open. That means you can spend and pay it off as much as your heart desires (and your wallet allows), for the first decade. After that, that account freezes and essentially becomes just like any other loan, with a fixed payoff period.\nIdeally, I want to take the second route. If I can truly get the amount of money that my calculations are projecting (which is still rather mind-boggling to me), then I should be able to make some pretty massive payments to the other debts and get a great many of them paid off by the end of the year. [Insert comic-book style \u0026ldquo;ka-CHUNK\u0026rdquo; sound text here.]\nGetting those paid off kills yet more debt and removes their monthly payments, which, if nothing else, will only further help in the lean times.\nDoor Number 3? There is also a third route that I may consider: alternating what gets paid off/down. The idea here would be:\nPay down the HELOC enough to get the deck. Switch to one of the other loans and pay it off. By my calculations, this should take 1-3 months for all of the remaining loans that aren\u0026rsquo;t things the mortgage, the remaining car (the remaining car is currently a lease, but will likely become a purchase loan when the lease expires in a year), and student loans. Switch to the HELOC and pay for 1-2 months, which should pay a large chunk of it down, freeing us to make home improvements as necessary (the idea here being that either we don\u0026rsquo;t do big projects unless necessary or \u0026ldquo;saved up\u0026rdquo; for, or it frees us up to do some of the smaller quality of life improvements). Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the smaller bills are all paid off. 4a. Pay off the car. Pay off the HELOC, then proceed to the big loans. 5a. Whenever we use the HELOC, switch back to it until it\u0026rsquo;s paid off. The advantage of this method is that it pays off the other debts while also paying down the HELOC enough to help us take care of the house. That way, we don\u0026rsquo;t have to try to put a total freeze on getting things fixed while we pay off the other stuff.\nThe disadvantage is that it requires that I\u0026rsquo;m working more or less full time, or bringing in the equivalent amount of money through some means or another, during that entire time. Sadly, I can\u0026rsquo;t consider that a given, and therefore can\u0026rsquo;t plan one way or another what strategy I\u0026rsquo;ll use. (It doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that I haven\u0026rsquo;t really gotten going at this new gig yet, and since it\u0026rsquo;s freelance, I can only bill when I\u0026rsquo;m actually contributing.)\nHere\u0026rsquo;s to another fire under my ass to find other sources of income, because clearly me and traditional employment don\u0026rsquo;t mix.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s A Wrap! As usual, this post is plenty long enough, so additional side stuff will go into one or more dedicated posts. Thanks to the Motley Fool podcast, I recently discovered a podcast about financial independence and the FIRE (financial independence, retire early) movement, and I\u0026rsquo;d like to talk about it, because the hosts of the podcast have a definition of FI that I agree with (in short, the ability to make choices, and that it\u0026rsquo;s not a binary thing). We\u0026rsquo;ll get to that then, and once I\u0026rsquo;ve had a chance to listen to some of their podcast episodes, so that will be next time.\n","date":"Nov 13, 2018","description":"That moment when everything seems to go wrong (and how I'm weathering it).","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2018/11/13/personal-finance-q4-2018-update/","series":"financial independence","subtitle":"When Life Hands You Lemons...","tags":["debt"],"title":"Personal Finance, Q4 2018 Update"},{"categories":["community"],"contents":"It\u0026rsquo;s the start of \u0026ldquo;Autism Awareness Month,\u0026rdquo; which, for those of us with Autism, tends to be \u0026ldquo;the month to run and hide and wish I didn\u0026rsquo;t like blue, because we get inundated with neurotypical people who think they know our experience better than we do.\u0026rdquo; I don\u0026rsquo;t often write about the effect of Autism on my life (either my son\u0026rsquo;s or my own\u0026rsquo;s), because to be honest, 99% of the time, it\u0026rsquo;s boring and uneventful.\nIn a bit of serendipity, I recently watched the Power Rangers movie that came out a year or so ago. As a 90s kid, I grew up with the original series, so my husband and I were bored and decided to watch it. It had its corny moments (and the premise as a whole is a bit campy, as it\u0026rsquo;s always been), but overall it\u0026rsquo;s quite good.\nWhat stuck out to me, though, was Billy, the Blue Ranger. As an original series fan, Billy was always my favorite. I identified with the nerdy, bespectacled Blue Ranger. So, when the \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; movie Billy was first introduced, I was a bit taken aback. However, he quickly grew on me, and by the end of the movie, my appreciation for the character had been renewed and even strengthened.\nThe original Power Rangers was actually rather revolutionary in its diverse cast. In hindsight, the color assignments were rather stereotypical, but it was 1993. I\u0026rsquo;m willing to let bygones be bygones and appreciate the attempt, especially since the new movie seems to have learned from its past, while keeping with its habit of pushing boundaries. Pink is still the cheerleader type girl, but the Asian character is no longer Yellow Ranger (and Yellow is the first LGBTQ superhero) and the African American is no longer Black Ranger, though in an ironic twist, they made the Autistic character the Blue Ranger.\nYep, Billy\u0026rsquo;s Autistic. And not in the kinda-sorta-not-really way that The Big Bang Theory\u0026rsquo;s Sheldon or Criminal Minds\u0026rsquo; Dr. Reid, where the writers hint at it, but then pull back at the last possible moment of actually making them Autistic. Nope, Power Rangers brings it up pretty early, when Billy tells Jason straight-up \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m on the Spectrum.\u0026rdquo;\nA little bit of banter ensues, where Jason jokingly feigns ignorance of what \u0026ldquo;the Spectrum\u0026rdquo; means, giving an opportunity to provide a little bit of information about what being Autistic means for him, including not getting Jason\u0026rsquo;s joke, and even explains that his brain\u0026rsquo;s wired differently (to which Jason responds that that\u0026rsquo;s not a bad thing).\nOne of the things that I appreciated about the movie was that although the movie was upfront about it, it didn\u0026rsquo;t focus as heavily on it as some shows and movies have. His Autism is part of his character, but the story isn\u0026rsquo;t about his Autism, and he isn\u0026rsquo;t just a bunch of stereotypes. The astute viewer will see the subtle (and not so subtle) things that indicate his neurodivergence, such as the lining up of the colored pencils in detention, or the stimming during one of the morph scenes, but will also notice that he makes eye contact with his friends (whom he values deeply, which is arguably why he can make eye contact with them).\nHe\u0026rsquo;s also the first to morph. This is huge within the movie\u0026rsquo;s arc, because the team\u0026rsquo;s entire ability to morph depends on them working as one, relating to one another, and caring about one another. To have Billy be the first one to morph shows the level of care and loyalty that he has toward his friends and illustrates that not only can Autistics love and care for people, but that we can do so deeply and profoundly.\nAdditionally, Jason, in particular treats him as an equal, while still helping him when needed, such as encouraging Billy when he\u0026rsquo;s stressed, helping stop a bully, or being non-chalant about the news that Billy\u0026rsquo;s on the Spectrum. Outside of the movie, Billy\u0026rsquo;s actor, RJ Cyler, sat down and just listened to Autistic people. He did his homework.\nI actually sat down and shut my mouth and actually just listened and you know, accepted every bit of information with no judgement… I knew that it was my job to show, you know, that people that are on the spectrum are just regular people, literally, just how we talk, how me and Becky [Becky G, Yellow Ranger] talk, they feel the same way, they have the same emotions, they wanna be loved, that want people to love, they want relationships they want, you know, connections, and it’s just like I was really excited to be able to play that ’cause I know it means so much to so many people, ’cause all of us are affected by it… and it’s something I feel like we needed to have in this movie to be honest.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s this kind of awareness and acceptance of Autism and this kind of portrayal (where it\u0026rsquo;s there, but not the primary focus of the story) that we need. Billy certainly isn\u0026rsquo;t the representative of Autism \u0026ndash; no single person is or can be \u0026ndash; but he\u0026rsquo;s a valuable character to have to be able to illustrate part of the range of neurodiversity and the positives it contains.\n","date":"Apr 1, 2018","description":"Musings on the protrayal of neurodivergence in entertainment.","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2018/04/01/autism-awareness-and-the-blue-ranger/","series":null,"subtitle":null,"tags":["community contribution","HackTheStigma"],"title":"Autism Awareness And The Blue Ranger"},{"categories":["personal development"],"contents":"As I\u0026rsquo;ve more actively sought out leadership positions, one of the things I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about is the concept of core values. I see them actually communicated most often at the organization level, but I believe we have them at a personal level, too. We just don\u0026rsquo;t codify them. I like documenting things (because I like understanding), and since these are things I\u0026rsquo;d like to instill in the people I mentor and lead, I figured it\u0026rsquo;d be good to write them out and start documenting and exploring, and ultimately refining them.\nAlways Be Learning Life is a never-ending series of new things to learn and explore, if you let it. As a developer, this is almost an imperative. Learning gives us new perspectives and new tools, allowing us to do our best, then to do better.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Fear Failure Many people do what they can to avoid failure. Our society says failure is bad. That can\u0026rsquo;t be farther from the truth. Failure means you\u0026rsquo;ve pushed your limits, and that\u0026rsquo;s where the most learning comes from. Humans learn best from mistakes, and it\u0026rsquo;s when we push ourselves to the point of failure that we grow the most (#LifeLessonsFromWeightlifting).\nRoot Cause Analysis And Setting Ego Aside When failure does happen, we still need to fix it, but we can\u0026rsquo;t do that if egos are in the way. Instead, we use tools such as \u0026ldquo;The 5 Whys\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;The Inifinite Hows.\u0026rdquo; These help us determine potential root causes or contributing factors, which we can address in order to fix the systemic factors of an error, so long as we\u0026rsquo;re careful to not let it reduce to blaming someone.\nCriticism Is Opportunity In Disguise Criticism, even the worst kinds of it, shows us ways in which our work can improve and grow, and highlights pain points a person has (even if they can\u0026rsquo;t articulate them). It gives us new problems to solve and new paths of discovery. Strive to find the opportunities when faced with criticism, and remember that most criticism comes from a desire to see improvement.\nBe Constructive There will be times where we\u0026rsquo;ll need or want to provide feedback to others. When we do, we should always strive to be constructive about it. When giving negative feedback, try to offer solution suggestions, or if we don\u0026rsquo;t have solution ideas (that\u0026rsquo;s okay, too), offer to help find some. Stay objective with criticism. Our pain points are others\u0026rsquo; paths of opportunity, not their personal faults. Additionally, remember to provide positive feedback. It\u0026rsquo;s at least as important to tell others what they are doing right.\nGive Feedback Immediately Whether positive or negative, feedback should be given immediately (and yes, this means we should be frequently providing feedback to others). Delaying feedback only serves to weaken positive feedback, and cause confusion, frustration, and anxiety around negative feedback. Providing immediate feedback allows the recipient to adjust accordingly, on the fly. Consider a hot stove \u0026ndash; if you touch a hot stove, you immediately feel the heat and the pain. It may hurt, but that immediate feedback saves you from the more severe burns that you would have obtained had that feedback been delayed. Interpersonal feedback works much the same way.\nSay What You Mean, And Mean What You Say A lot of people have a habit of saying something other than what they mean. This is commonly known as indirect communication, and while it frequently comes from good intentions (not wanting to hurt feelings), it often causes more problems than it solves, because it requires guessing at true meanings. Instead, say what you mean, and when you say something, mean it. No reading between lines. No guessing games.\nNote: this is not a free pass to be a jerk in the name of \u0026ldquo;directness\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;honesty.\u0026rdquo; It is possible to be a direct communicator and still have tact and show compassion.\nBe Transparent In the vast majority of cases, it\u0026rsquo;s better to give too much information than too little. Joel Gascoigne of Buffer put it quite well: Transparency breeds trust, and trust is the foundation of great teamwork. Transparency also keeps us honest, not just with others, but with ourselves.\nWhen we\u0026rsquo;re in leadership positions, this may take some practice to balance tranparency and expectation management, but it can be done. This extra balancing reinforces that we need to be mindful of what we say and how we say it in order to get our intended meaning across (this goes hand in hand with the previous value).\nDo What\u0026rsquo;s Right What\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; in a given situation? Well, that depends on the situation and is informed by the rest of one\u0026rsquo;s ethics and morals. Likewise, doing what\u0026rsquo;s right may carry a certain risk with it, making it challenging. Regardless, the right thing per one\u0026rsquo;s own ethics and morals is still the right thing and is still the best thing to do. Nothing is worth compromising your values over.\nTake Ownership Or, as the entrepreneur circles say, \u0026ldquo;own yo\u0026rsquo; shit.\u0026rdquo; In this case, \u0026ldquo;yo\u0026rsquo; shit\u0026rdquo; is not just the negative things (such as owning up to mistakes), but also positive things (such as taking credit for your achievements).\nApologize and take ownership of when you\u0026rsquo;ve actually done wrong, hurt someone, made a mistake, etc., and only when you\u0026rsquo;ve done those things. Don\u0026rsquo;t apologize for things like speaking up about something, raising red flags, protecting others, taking care of yourself, etc. Needlessly apologizing cheapens your apologies and conveys that Doing The Right Thing is somehow wrong. It\u0026rsquo;s not. You have a right to speak up and be heard. You have a right to raise concerns and offer suggestions. You have a right to take up space. You have the right to set boundaries.\nLikewise, make your accomplishments and contributions known. You put in the work, you did the learning, you had the experience. You deserve to own and be recognized for that. Many people don\u0026rsquo;t like to do this for fear of being branded a braggart. It\u0026rsquo;s a legitimate concern and requires some practice to balance, but it is possible to make your contributions known and visible without being a braggart (and following the other values mentioned here goes a long way toward doing that), such as not pawning off (all of the) credit for something you did to other people and not minimizing your contribution. You\u0026rsquo;re part of the team, too. Making your contributions invisible renders you invisible and devalues your worth to the organization.\nTake Care Of Yourself Many of us have been conditioned to believe that putting ourselves first, ever, is selfish and we avoid doing so like the plague. Stop, and stop feeling guilty for doing something for you once in a while. The problem is that we\u0026rsquo;ve created a dichotomous way of thinking that the only way to be selfish is to put oneself first and the only way to be selfless is to always put others first.\nBeing selfish is defined as lacking consideration for others and concerned chiefly with one\u0026rsquo;s own personal profit or pleasure. A selfish person is only concerned about hirself. That\u0026rsquo;s the difference. Unfortunately, we have been conditioned such that we often no longer see that difference, and as a result, we end up putting everyone before us to the point that we crash and burn.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t help others if you have no means by which to help them. If you spend all of your energy on others, then you have no more energy to give. In order to help people in the long run (and ultimately, better help more people), you have to take a step back and refill your own reserves.

As they do, things have since changed, and I figured I\u0026rsquo;d update accordingly.\nChanges To Travis And .travis.yml Travis recently made several updates, many of which make our job easier.\nBuild Settings Travis now has the option to build only if a .travis.yml file is present. Before, you needed a .travis.yml file in both your source and your display branch. Now, that\u0026rsquo;s no longer the case.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also the ability to auto-cancel queued builds that haven\u0026rsquo;t yet started and only build the latest push or pull request. While this ought to have limited use on a blog (unless you\u0026rsquo;re like me and find or think of things immediately after pushing a commit), it\u0026rsquo;s still a neat feature.\nNo More Encrypted Travis Keys! Okay, that sounds bad out of context, but it\u0026rsquo;s actually a good thing. Before, the key needed for Travis to push the built content to production had to be in the .travis.yml file. While it was encrypted, it still wasn\u0026rsquo;t really good practice. That\u0026rsquo;s no longer an issue, because Travis now has an \u0026ldquo;Environment Variables\u0026rdquo; section.\nSo, where you would have set up that key, you now just take the key and set it in the Travis dashboard, using the same variable name. Yay! No more keys in the repo!\nBuilt In Deploy To Github Another update precludes the need for the ghp-import script in the Makefile, and renders this entire section moot.\nInstead, our script section simplifies slightly and we add a deploy section:\nThis new section is particularly cool, because it supports a ton of different platforms, so you\u0026rsquo;re no longer bound to Github. You can declaratively deploy to almost anywhere, simply by changing the provider and updating the options accordingly.\nFor more information, be sure to check out the documentation.\nChanges To Pelican Config The main change to the config is with the Markdown plugin.\nWe went from this:\nTo this:\nWhile it looks more complicated, it\u0026rsquo;s a lot more expressive.\nHappy blogging!\n","date":"Sep 1, 2017","description":"Updating Pelican and the Travis config to account for changes in both.

As a result, I have become quite familiar with their documentation and its gaps. The HMAC verification piece of the OAuth/embedded app installation process is a particularly glaring gap. So let\u0026rsquo;s close it.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Wrong With The Docs? If you\u0026rsquo;re a Ruby developer, probably not much. Shopify\u0026rsquo;s got a nice little Ruby gem that does a great deal of the work for you. Happy days!\nBut for a PHP developer like myself? Well\u0026hellip;the docs look pretty much like this:\nCreate an app in the dashboard Add the redirect code ???? Profit! What\u0026rsquo;s even worse, is that one of the few libraries and step-by-step PHP examples are both wrong in how they do HMAC verification! (The fact that that guide is on Shopify, proper, is astounding to me.)\nOkay, so that entire section is in dire need of a good tutorial for those not blessed with Ruby. I\u0026rsquo;ll get to that in the near future. In the meantime, I want to have out there the correct way of doing HMAC verification.\nThe Right Way The documentation does actually give us the information on how to correctly generate the HMAC value, but it does so in a language-agnostic way (which is all well and good, but requires quite a bit of fiddling to get it right).\nThey can be summarized as follows:\nPull everything from the request except the HMAC and signature fields Sort remaining items lexilogically Replace special characters in keys and values Hash per HMAC standards with the shared secret (query string, SHA256) If done properly, the generate string should match the HMAC field Shopify sent.\nNow, what\u0026rsquo;s that look like in PHP? Pretty simple, thankfully:\nIf you happen to be running Laravel, you can clean it up a little, like this:\nHow does this differ from the other ways? For the most part, the fatal error in the available examples is that they do step 1 (of all things) backwards. Instead of taking the request and removing the keys that need removed, they all built an array from the keys in the example code in the documentation. This was all well and good while the response from Shopify matched the documentation, but as soon as they changed that response, well\u0026hellip;everything broke.\nBut, now you have it! The right way to do Shopify\u0026rsquo;s HMAC verification. In the near future, I\u0026rsquo;ll be writing up a tutorial on how to painlessly set up a Shopify embedded app in PHP.\n","date":"Aug 24, 2017","description":"Filling the gap between Shopify's documentation and reality when it comes to verification of new embedded apps.","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2017/08/24/shopify-hmac-verification/","series":null,"subtitle":"The Right Way","tags":["shopify","oauth","php"],"title":"Shopify HMAC Verification"},{"categories":["finance"],"contents":"In part 2, I mentioned that I\u0026rsquo;m \u0026ldquo;productively lazy,\u0026rdquo; and prefer to automate what I can. Well, I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to do that with my finances.\nHello, Automation! My husband finally got officially hired by his work, which converted him to salary. This gave us two benefits \u0026ndash; 1. his income is no longer locked to his hours, so the paychecks are the same, and 2. he and I are now on the same pay schedule (which makes for a really pretty number on payday).\nThe synchronized paychecks is a bit of a mixed blessing. On the positive side, it makes my calculation for the monthly budget that much easier. It was a pain in the ass to calculate how much had to be allocated from which check, when one came every week and the other twice monthly. I got it, but it was cumbersome, and I had to account for my husband taking a day off (the most common time off use case for us). On the negative side\u0026hellip;I lose the nice little smoothing effect a weekly paycheck allowed. Having a weekly paycheck allowed for grocery expenses to be pulled from it, for example. That\u0026rsquo;s been the biggest adjustment for me, and I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest, it\u0026rsquo;s been surprisingly tough.\nIt does greatly simplify my allocations, though. Instead of having to calculate how much comes from which check and setting up a bunch of transactions with different cadences, monthly allocations are simply divided by 2 and assigned to wherever they need to go with just a couple of monthly recurring transactions.\nThis also makes the vast majority of the bill paying a fair bit simpler. Since half of the money is available on the 1st and 16th of every month, I know which bills can get paid with each cycle. From there, it\u0026rsquo;s a matter of setting up my account to pay the bills at the correct time.\nThis is where things get a bit tricky, because now we have to deal with the bills and the technical systems between them and my bank, as well as the fact that some of the bills are on mandatory autopay via the company the subscription is through.\nPush Me, Pull You Personally, I\u0026rsquo;d prefer it if all of the commands to pay bills were originating from my bank. A \u0026ldquo;push\u0026rdquo; system, as opposed to a \u0026ldquo;pull\u0026rdquo; system, if you will. I like it this way, because then I can see all of the past and upcoming transactions in one location.\nUnfortunately, reality doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow for that. Some require autopay via the biller, while for others, if I want autopay, I have to do it through the bank, and still others don\u0026rsquo;t really have a sane way to handle autopay at all (variable amount bill + no digital billing system). Likewise, some things can do e-billing into my bank, while others won\u0026rsquo;t, and in one case, it says it does, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually work (which I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t care so much about, except for the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s a variable amount bill).\nThe result is that some originate from the bank, while others originate from the billing company, and a couple need paid manually. Far from perfect, but a step in the right direction. This is where the spreadsheet I created when I first started comes in handy. I set it up with some creative conditional formatting to color differently depending on if the note has \u0026ldquo;autopay via bank\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;autopay via merchant.\u0026rdquo; Bank ones have their due dates changed to a pale green, merchant ones to completely gray, and the couple of remaining oddballs retain the old rotating color highlight.\nFully Automating The Bucket-Filling I already had some of this in place before, but with the synchronized and salary paychecks, I can automate the entirety of all the allocations, which is nice. It means that I don\u0026rsquo;t have to think about moving more money, based on how much we actually got in the paycheck, and whatever\u0026rsquo;s left after the allocations go through is the amount left for food, gas, and miscellaneous expenses for the cycle.\nNow I just need to reign in the expenses that have been expanding since the pocketbook has been able to open\u0026hellip; (We\u0026rsquo;ll come back to that in a minute.)\nMeeting (And Exceeding) Goals With The Power Of Automation I\u0026rsquo;m now up to 10% allocation for both my Giving and my Savings bucket (yay!).\nThis has been tremendously great news for my life goal of \u0026ldquo;giving back,\u0026rdquo; where it has allowed me to donate to The Trevor Project, back several Kickstarter projects (including being the difference between funding and not for a women of color owned shirt project), and even help out my mother-in-law (who found herself unemployed for what amounts to taking too much time off to care for her dad who nearly died last fall; clearly getting asshole managers runs in the family).\nFor my savings, it\u0026rsquo;s been a bit more mixed. I\u0026rsquo;ve been successful at saving, but I\u0026rsquo;ve had to actually make use of it for its currently-intended purpose – as a buffer for when I run short of cash, as well as for rare fun stuff (like\u0026hellip;you know\u0026hellip;a real, bona fide vacation).\nOn the positive side, I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to keep enough in it that paying the other half of the vacation cabin fee was a non-issue (the same goes for the budget/spending adjustment from the change in pay schedule). On the negative side, my savings account balance isn\u0026rsquo;t where I\u0026rsquo;d really like it to be (a month or more worth of expenses), even though it could have been. This has pushed my investment plans back a little more than I\u0026rsquo;d have liked, but we got to spend a much-needed and well-earned week in the Smoky Mountains. I\u0026rsquo;ll take living life over hoarding money any day.\nRevisiting Wave I have a love-hate relationship with Wave. I love the charts and the overall user experience, but I don\u0026rsquo;t love the fact that it still doesn\u0026rsquo;t properly pick up the transfers between accounts. Having to go back through and find the dropped transactions in a double-entry system is\u0026hellip;painful. However, I still need to be able to revisit the overview, so that I can pinpoint exactly where the money leaks are and address them accordingly (when your cash flow calculations say you should have somewhere in the ballpark of $1,000 extra each month and you don\u0026rsquo;t, you tend to want to know where that money is going). It\u0026rsquo;s kind of hard to do that when you\u0026rsquo;ve all but abandoned it because of those little annoyances, then all of your accounts are out of whack when you come back to it, so all the budgets are messed up and the whole thing ends up meaningless.\nTime For A Fresh Start As much as I like Wave otherwise, I decided it was time to see what else was on the market. When looking for new software, I really only had two make-or-break requirements:\nIt has to have transaction categorization and \u0026ldquo;ten thousand foot view\u0026rdquo; It has to be able to properly sync with my bank From there, it\u0026rsquo;d be nice if it were free, since I don\u0026rsquo;t use it frequently enough to warrant a paid subscription, though I was willing to compromise and pay a small fee (ideally $5/mo) if that\u0026rsquo;s what was required to get what I\u0026rsquo;m looking for.\nAnd\u0026hellip;I found it and more, though not in a way I entirely expected. I happened across an app called Personal Capital, which I actually dismissed the first time I looked at it, but after taking a second look and ultimately signing up to try it out, I immediately fell in love.\nUnlike most of the other personal finance software out there, Personal Capital is designed to show you your net worth. You link up all your accounts (and ideally, I do mean all), and it assesses them all and gives you your net worth, then provides you with tools to increase that number. It\u0026rsquo;s all really cool.\nThe catch, though, is that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really do everyday budgeting (you can do long-term stuff, like retirement savings or saving for a big purchase, though). It does provide that high-level view of categorized spending that I was looking for, though, which is exactly what I was looking for. And it does a damn good job at properly categorizing things (well, except for Turkey Hill purchases, but I blame that on bad data; Turkey Hill\u0026rsquo;s transaction label is so off the wall that it even took me a minute to figure out what it was). And it displays pretty circle and line charts to boot, and the categories on both the list and the circle chart are clickable and will filter the transactions by that category; major props to the UI/UX team).\nSeriously, look at these beauties! Best of all, this part is free. They make their money doing personalized financial planning and asset management for people with $100k+ net worth.\nIt gave me that much-needed overview of the finances, giving me hard numbers about what I already expecteed—we\u0026rsquo;re eating out way too damn much right now. Between that and picking up various smaller quality of life improvements, it became very evident where that extra money was going.\nFinally, Quick Update On Debt Payment Now that it\u0026rsquo;s taken me nearly four months to write this, I\u0026rsquo;ll have one last section before I wrap this post up \u0026ndash; an update on my debt payoff plan. I just updated that plan, in fact, now that I\u0026rsquo;ve mostly settled into the new pay cadence, since my old calculations weren\u0026rsquo;t really matching reality.\nWhile I could be doing better, I\u0026rsquo;m doing rather well. Granted, if I were left on my own, to my own devices, I\u0026rsquo;d have probably been far more aggressive and would be farther than I am, but with a family, I have to balance life in general. That meant getting a new refigerator and a much-needed window replacement. Despite both going on credit, I consider them both worthy investments that will help in the long run.\nQuick Rationale Alright, I know what you might be thinking—why in the world would I buy a new fridge when my old one still worked? Well, the better description was that it functioned. You see, it was one of those cheap 28\u0026quot; side-by-sides. If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever had them and tried to use them for a family, you probably know they suck. Neither side is wide enough to fit much of anything, so everything gets stacked front-to-back, resulting in food that was frequently lost and forgotten about and ultimately gone to waste.\nI hate wasting food.\nSo, when our microwave died and we ended up at ApplianceSmart to get a new one, we opted to get a fridge, too. We already have their credit card, and they basically have an ongoing \u0026ldquo;same as cash\u0026rdquo; deal with it. I knew I could have it paid off well before the promotional period, so it was also a good opportunity to rebuild the credit score a bit. Wins all around.\nAs for the windows\u0026hellip;well\u0026hellip;let\u0026rsquo;s just say the air conditioner was thanking us before the job was even completed.\nBack On Track So, while I may have technically incurred more debt, I had paid off one card at the beginning of the year, I\u0026rsquo;ll have the fridge paid off by November (or sooner if I get fed up with it and dip into savings to drop it off, since I hate having balances under about $1,500 for any length of time), dropped something like $3,000 off the otherwise last remaining credit card, and several thousand off my car.\nThat last credit card will be the roughest of all my debts, since it\u0026rsquo;s a credit card and therefore has a credit card\u0026rsquo;s interest rate. So once that\u0026rsquo;s dealt with, I should start seeing bigger dents in the other stuff, even if their balances are higher. If I can reign in the extra spending a bit, I can even accelerate that, since I\u0026rsquo;m not putting in nearly what I could be for the snowball effort.\n","date":"Aug 23, 2017","description":"Automate ALL THE THINGS!","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2017/08/23/personal-finance-part-3/","series":"financial independence","subtitle":"Unlocking the Power of Automation","tags":["tips","debt"],"title":"Personal Finance, Part 3"},{"categories":["finance"],"contents":"Back in part 1 I described the system that I used to work on getting my family out of debt and make ends meet. We\u0026rsquo;re now coming up on a year, so how did I do? Does this system actually work?\nPutting The System To Work So, did it work? Well, as an acquaintance put it, there was \u0026ldquo;no budge in the budget,\u0026rdquo; but\u0026hellip;yeah, it has been working. In fact, it saved our hides when things fell apart a few months ago. I did tweak a few things, though.\nThe Buffer Bucket The original goal for the Buffer bucket was to keep enough money for a month or more for when bills fell short. That didn\u0026rsquo;t quite pan out like I had hoped, but it did serve the purpose of having a bit of overflow shared between the two checking accounts, to prevent overdraft and the fees associated with that. The balance just stayed smaller.\nWave Once everything got set up, I found that I didn\u0026rsquo;t really need Wave anymore. I had also ran into a bug with their integration with Ally that resulted in Wave not picking up the automated fund transfers between accounts. That meant that every week, I\u0026rsquo;d have to go in and manually enter it. And Wave uses the double-entry system, so you have to enter it on both sides and match them both up. It\u0026rsquo;s great for ensuring you get everything, but cumbersome to actually do, especially when it\u0026rsquo;s just one or two transactions amid couple dozen across four accounts.\nHowever, once I had everything organized and in place, I didn\u0026rsquo;t really need it as much, because each account was self-documenting. The only money coming out of the primary account, for example, was either being transferred to one of the other accounts, or was being used for food and gas. Money coming out of the Bill Pay Limbo account was only going to bills.\nThis was easy when we were on one income and had very little budget room, because all other spending was pretty much halted. I may go back to it, now that my husband and I are both working again, and we\u0026rsquo;ll have more room for other budgetary items (which I\u0026rsquo;ll address shortly).\nHow The System Saved My Hide For the entire spring and summer, things were going well. The system was working, I was whittling away on the only credit card left. Bills were not only getting consistently paid on time, but actually ahead of schedule. I had managed to work the payment cycle back from paying at the last possible moment to a week or more ahead of time. I had the bills due the first week of the month paid by the 21st of the month before. I had a small, but growing, savings.\nAnd\u0026hellip;then shit hit the fan. Two weeks before Labor Day, my husband started experiencing tooth pain. No big deal, right? Okay, it was enough to warrant a trip to the dentist and a day or two off work, but still, not a big deal. My system had been in place long enough that I can weather some hiccups. It\u0026rsquo;s not ideal if I have to tap into the savings, but I can deal with it, and if I have to tap into it, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be much, because I\u0026rsquo;m ahead on the payment schedule.\nBut then, a couple of days turned into a week, as my husband\u0026rsquo;s dental issue kept getting worse and not responding to the antibiotics. And remember, he was contract hourly. No work, no income. Extraction day was moved up to Monday (from the Friday before Labor Day), because he was still missing work and wasn\u0026rsquo;t getting better. The dentist puts him under the twilight sedation and\u0026hellip;they can\u0026rsquo;t open his jaw, and because he was already under, no one else would take him that day. We\u0026rsquo;ve now crossed the full week line.\nTuesday, we finally get him into a dental surgeon that will work with my husband and the issues he\u0026rsquo;s having. Surgeon promptly tells him to check into the hospital, because an abscess has formed and where it is and what it\u0026rsquo;s doing (keeping his jaw from opening and going into the throat area), he can\u0026rsquo;t do it as outpatient. Surgery doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually happen until about 9pm that night, and because of the circumstances, he had to stay in for another two days (released on Thursday) to be monitored and ensure the pathogen doesn\u0026rsquo;t come back (contrary to common belief that dental issues are always caused by neglect, it turned out that his were caused by a virus that eats teeth, and on top of that, it was a mutation that did so faster than the typical strain; literally, the CDC says \u0026ldquo;if you find it, pull teeth until you stop finding it\u0026rdquo;; he didn\u0026rsquo;t get the infection because his teeth were rotting, his teeth were rotting because of the infection).\nHe\u0026rsquo;s released Thursday, but we both agree that it makes more sense to stay home on Friday and go back on Tuesday (because Monday was Labor Day). We had been in contact with his employer as best we could, given that we had no access to his work email (yay, password policies!). Now, we\u0026rsquo;re at two weeks without income. Surprisingly, though, had that been it, we would have recovered without much issue. The bills were still getting paid, and the worst issue was that I had to add a bit to the credit card balance for the food at the hospital. A bit disappointing, but only a minor setback in the long run, and I could make up for it in the next couple of months, with a bit extra to that bill.\nTuesday and Wednesday were uneventful, until Wednesday evening, when my husband\u0026rsquo;s contracting house calls him to inform him that his manager has fired him (yes, because of his medical issues; yes, it\u0026rsquo;s shady as hell, yes it\u0026rsquo;s legal; thank you loopholes in FMLA and other worker protection laws).\nWell\u0026hellip;shit. The couple of days that week helped float us through a bit more, but the simple fact of the matter was that we didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough income to put a larger amount of savings away, and I hadn\u0026rsquo;t had enough time to build the buffer needed to weather this. The unemployment checks helped us keep up with the bills that were absolutely essential to not miss, and the offset I had was still sufficient to handle some of the other bills.\nAs a result, by the time I started my new job (as it happened, I had been keeping my ear to the ground before this all started happening, so I had a couple leads that were now coming to fruition), I had only fallen behind on two bills, one of which (the credit card), we were able to contact, explain the situation, and get the missed payment forgiven. The other one was the phone bill, which allows for a missed month without too much detriment as long as it\u0026rsquo;s caught up in a timely manner. So, it got paid in the second half of the month, instead of on time, and is back on schedule.\nNote: The Forgiven Missed Payment Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at that one a bit closer. I was chatting with some people on a Slack team I\u0026rsquo;m on, and one of them mentioned that trying to work with credit card companies feels like a lost cause, because as the recipient of the card, we have no leverage, especially if we\u0026rsquo;re in a tight spot.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s only partially true. Credit card companies make money off of us when we spend money using their cards. The carrier that keeps a balance and faithfully makes payments without paying off the balance is their dream customer, because the credit card company gets steady income from that person, and will for some time. So, even if your previous income was modest, as long as you had been paying on your credit card, they have incentive to work with you.\nIn my case, that meant forgiveness of the fees and interest incurred by that missed payment. I had been paying my card down for the better part of the year, but had an abrupt problem that we were motivated to fix and were on track to do so soon. As a result, they were willing to work with us, since we called and gave them a head\u0026rsquo;s up on the issue.\nRebounding The beauty of this system was that it allowed us to weather the issue with minimal damage. Yeah, it hurt (I will say we did have to live on Ramen and Aldi brand mac \u0026amp; cheese for a couple of weeks), but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t so bad that we couldn\u0026rsquo;t recover from it once we got income back again. This was even before I had been able to build any kind of \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; savings.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the important part, here, because let\u0026rsquo;s be real—life\u0026rsquo;s going to happen. If you can manage to pull off an entire snowball debt elimination plan without experiencing something that sets you back at least a little bit, then either you\u0026rsquo;ve gotten extremely lucky, or you didn\u0026rsquo;t have much debt to begin with.\nGoing Forward Now, I\u0026rsquo;ve started working again (largely because I wanted to), and my husband also has a new job. This puts our income back at double what it was for the vast majority of the past year. What am I going to do with all this extra cash?! Actually, I have most of it planned out already, and for the most part, it\u0026rsquo;s just bigger numbers in various buckets, though there are a couple of additional buckets.\n1. A Dedicated \u0026ldquo;Snowball\u0026rdquo; Bucket One of the challenges I\u0026rsquo;m dealing with right now is that the pay cycles are a bit weird. My husband gets paid in the middle of each week, and I get paid twice monthly. Now, I\u0026rsquo;m loving the twice monthly cadence, because it naturally gets me into a \u0026ldquo;1st and 15th\u0026rdquo; pattern, instead of having to deal with it weekly. However, only part of our income comes from that, and I still have to deal with the weekly income cycle. Where this gets complicated is figuring out exactly how much goes where at what time. It will work itself out over the next few months, but it\u0026rsquo;s a bit tricky to get wrapped around in the beginning, at least for me.\nTo help remedy this problem, and to again reduce mental overhead of keeping track of how much goes to what (I\u0026rsquo;m a programmer, so I am, by nature, productively lazy\u0026amp;emdash;the more I can pawn off to trusted automation, the happier I am), I have a dedicated \u0026ldquo;snowball\u0026rdquo; account. During the month, bills get paid as scheduled, including any of the existing snowball amount that I had already established (i.e.—the credit card\u0026rsquo;s minimum payment is $200, but I\u0026rsquo;ve been paying $350 on it; yes, I know that\u0026rsquo;s not actually how the snowball thing works, but at this point, especially, it\u0026rsquo;s a relative drop in the bucket, and it brings that one down away from being maxed out; it\u0026rsquo;s largely moot, anyway, since it\u0026rsquo;s top of the list after the first month). Then, the extra amount that\u0026rsquo;s going to be allotted to snowballing gets dumped into this bucket (which I\u0026rsquo;ve set up as a savings account), and at the end of the month, the money in there goes to the target bill as an extra payment.\nThere are two reasons I\u0026rsquo;ve set it up as a savings account:\nIt discourages withdrawal from it. Ally\u0026rsquo;s savings accounts have a 6 withdrawal per month limit. After that amount, you get charged a fee for withdrawing. That\u0026rsquo;s fine by me, because it incentivizes getting the amounts right for the budget, and sticking to it. I\u0026rsquo;d rather dump more into it at the end of a week or bill payment cycle than have to constantly withdraw from it.\nAlly requires overdraft protection accounts to be savings accounts. Since the snowball is \u0026ldquo;extra\u0026rdquo; money, in a sense, this account replaced the \u0026ldquo;Buffer\u0026rdquo; account (in fact, all I really did was rename the existing Buffer account). If I budget wrong, or I go over budget in another area, then I lose some of that \u0026ldquo;snowball\u0026rdquo; money, and take that much longer to pay stuff off. Since I\u0026rsquo;m anal retentive about getting stuff paid off as soon as I can, this works in my favor, because it makes me cringe if I have to pull from it for any reason other than advancing the snowball.\n2. A New \u0026ldquo;Giving\u0026rdquo; Bucket A principle that I hold dear is giving back to the community. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s the food pantry, an open source project, or simply someone I know that needs it, something I\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to do was give back in some way. Now that we\u0026rsquo;ve got some breathing room between our income and the bills that must be paid, I\u0026rsquo;ve added this bucket. Again, it\u0026rsquo;s a savings account, to help prevent pulling from it.\nIdeally, it will be 10% of our total net income. Right now, it\u0026rsquo;s closer to about 5%, because 10% runs us a bit tighter than I\u0026rsquo;m comfortable with. So, my plan at the moment is to allow for a couple of months for income to settle into its routine, for the holidays to pass, and for life in general to get back to normal. That will also allow me to pay off a couple of the recent bills from having to resurrect dormant credit cards, freeing that money back up to be reallocated.\n3. More In Savings, Then Investments Of course, one of the most wise things to do is build up a savings. As much as I dislike modern savings accounts (they are, in my opinion, the equivalent of stuffing money under the bed, since their interest rate is abysmal these days), they are useful for times of need such as what we recently went through.\nSo, my plan is to keep enough cash on hand in the savings account for 3 months of living expenses. Depending on exactly how aggressive I want to be with the snowball plan, I can have this as early as Midsummer. In fact, if I wanted to be really aggressive on this front, I could actually have this by Spring Equinox, but I\u0026rsquo;d rather work on getting rid of the debt, so I don\u0026rsquo;t have to keep as much liquid savings around to begin with.\nOnce I get around there, I\u0026rsquo;m going to start looking at financing investments. We\u0026rsquo;re not talking about CDs or bonds or other investments that barely exceed inflation (particularly after taxes are factored in). We\u0026rsquo;re talking about things like long-term stocks, tax lien investments, and other investments that most people see as riskier, but are far more lucrative if you\u0026rsquo;re willing to take such risks.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, I\u0026rsquo;m not about to jump head-first into what I hope is the deep end. This will likely start with some ramp-up time studying, probably a premium subscription to something like The Motley Fool, and some practice with a few \u0026ldquo;safer\u0026rdquo; options (such as brushing off my Merrill Edge account\u0026hellip;again\u0026hellip;and actually playing with the money that\u0026rsquo;s stashed there, that\u0026rsquo;s not worth liquidating) and following of stocks, which is actually something I\u0026rsquo;ve already passively started doing, in a way.\nSidestep: Watching The Market Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t invest anything yet, it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to start watching the market and playing a sort of economic game. What does a given event do to the market? What are the effects on different markets?\nWhile investing is generally a long game, watching some of these changes can help get you in at key times and make the most of your investments.\nBack To Your Regularly-Scheduled Section You may be wondering, \u0026ldquo;tax liens? Stocks? Are you nuts?\u0026rdquo; I have two words for you—compound interest \u0026lt;- that link right there is actually a lovely illustration for why I despise savings accounts, and that 0.1% is generous for savings accounts! To compare, Chase Bank\u0026rsquo;s standard savings account is one-tenth that. That\u0026rsquo;s right, a whopping 0.01%. If you invest $1,200, Chase gives you a whopping $4.81 over 40 years.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t spend it all in one place, now.\nSo yeah, if I\u0026rsquo;m going to be sitting on tens of thousands of dollars when times are good, because I have no interest in inflating my lifestyle to my means, I might as well put it to work for me. Ironically, by increasing my investment \u0026ldquo;risk,\u0026rdquo; I actually increase my financial security, because my reliance on trading my time for money (aka a job) decreases.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re getting way out of the realm of the whole snowball thing, though, but it does illustrate what you can start doing, once you get your debt under control and free up some cash.\nFuture Post: Better Interest On Cash Accounts? While writing this, I realized that I want to find something a little more lucrative for that wad of cash that I want to keep on hand, while still keeping it easily accessible. As it stands, the 1% interest rate I get on my savings accounts with Ally is pretty nice as far as savings accounts go, but can I do better? In a future post, I\u0026rsquo;ll be researching the options for easily-liquidated assets, cash accounts, or other means of investing money while keeping it easily accessible, as this and some basic stock market investing seem to be the logical next steps in my financial journey.\n","date":"Dec 16, 2016","description":"What I kept, what I scrapped, and how the whole thing saved my hide.","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2016/12/16/personal-finance-part-2/","series":"financial independence","subtitle":"The System After A Year","tags":["tips","debt"],"title":"Personal Finance, Part 2"},{"categories":["personal development"],"contents":"I got an invite from Cal Evans to watch this week\u0026rsquo;s episode of his weekly show, with this week\u0026rsquo;s topic being a public speaking Q\u0026amp;A with Adam Culp (as this is the third time Cal has pinged me regarding public speaking, I think he really wants me to start \u0026#x1f62e;). It got me thinking again about my feelings toward the prospect of public speaking for me.\nEspeically when it\u0026rsquo;s for larger audiences, my knee-jerk response to \u0026ldquo;you should give a talk,\u0026rdquo; has historically been \u0026ldquo;hell no.\u0026rdquo; For the longest time, I chalked it up to glossophobia (aka - stage fright/fear of public speaking). Recently, though, things in my life have changed such that the idea is no longer so panic-inducing.\nWhat Changed? My Self Esteem A year ago, I had next to no social life, no support network, no close friends, a marriage on the verge of collapse due to my husband\u0026rsquo;s at the time undiagnosed generalized anxiety disorder, and I was on the path to burn out in my software development career (and hell, I worked in software development, home of Imposter Syndrome). In retrospect, I\u0026rsquo;ve realized that my self esteem was essentially zero.\nIn the year that has since passed, all of those things have improved dramatically. My marriage is on the mend, I\u0026rsquo;ve found people I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to trust enough to get close to, I took a break from working for others so I could get back to the roots of why I became a developer to begin with. All these things have contributed to me feeling more confident in myself.\nWhy Support Networks Matter Arguably the biggest thing that has helped is the growth of my support network. I literally went from zero people I felt I could trust to help me when problems arose to\u0026hellip;about four dozen. No joke. Now, some of that was learning to trust the people who were already around, but it took finding some new people who were easier for me to trust in order to gain the courage to trust those people.\nOne of the biggest things that terrifies me is the idea that no one has my back on a matter in a meaningful way, because for a long time, it felt like no one had my back at all. That\u0026rsquo;s a very lonely feeling.\nThe changes in the past year have made me realize just how much true support networks mean to me. I have people I can fall back on when something happens that I can\u0026rsquo;t handle on my own. I have people who will support me when I have to defend myself. I have people who will cheer me on and congratulate me when I\u0026rsquo;ve done well and encourage me when facing uncertainty. I have people willing to teach me things I don\u0026rsquo;t know, without judgement over the fact that I don\u0026rsquo;t know those things (yet).\nThat last one is especially huge at a time in my life where I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m expected to know more than I currently do and feel like it\u0026rsquo;s increasingly rare to feel safe in saying \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know (but I can probably find out).\u0026rdquo;\nOn Feeling Safe I\u0026rsquo;ve seen a lot of criticism of things like \u0026ldquo;safe spaces\u0026rdquo; lately, and really, it saddens me. It\u0026rsquo;s great that the people who can say such criticisms feel safe just about anywhere, but unfortunately, not everyone shares that security.\nThe idea of safety as it relates to public speaking actually came up in a discussion I had with Ed Finkler, and Samantha Geitz and a couple of the other women speakers over burgers at last year\u0026rsquo;s Laracon US. In our chat, it came up that building up to large (and possibly less friendly) audiences was a process in expanding one\u0026rsquo;s personal feelings of safety in front of a group. Speaking at small user groups is less daunting, because many people feel safe speaking in front of smaller groups and people they know well. That can be slowly expanded by speaking in front of larger user groups and so on up the ladder until before you know it, you\u0026rsquo;re doing TED Talks and SXSW keynotes without breaking a sweat.\nBut what happens to that ladder if you don\u0026rsquo;t even feel safe standing on the ground? Like trying to stand a ladder on sand, it just doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen. We need that foundation of a sense of safety and security in our personal lives, before we can expand that \u0026ldquo;zone of safeness\u0026rdquo; into our professional ones. The fact that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have that foundation was thrown into spotlight last summer.\nGoing Forward It will probably still be a while before I\u0026rsquo;ll be comfortable saying \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; to the prospect of giving talks, but even now, what was a \u0026ldquo;hell no\u0026rdquo; has started becoming a \u0026ldquo;hmmm\u0026hellip;.maybe.\u0026rdquo; For me, that\u0026rsquo;s progress, and that\u0026rsquo;s what matters most right now.\n","date":"Jun 29, 2016","description":"On the importance of psychological safety when it comes to stage fright.","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2016/06/29/on-public-speaking-and-self-esteem/","series":null,"subtitle":null,"tags":["public speaking"],"title":"On Public Speaking And Self Esteem"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"So, three months have passed since Shipt launched. So, how is it going?\nWell\u0026hellip; these Facebook posts are rather indicative:\nWhat Happened? Well, they recently made a change to their algorithm for order offers, which has greatly upset a great number of the shoppers and even for those that aren\u0026rsquo;t upset, it has altered how people schedule. Some people have removed themselves from the schedule out of protest, while others have done so out of necessity, so that their ranking isn\u0026rsquo;t affected by missing offers while working at another job.\nThe end result, though, is the same (especially in smaller/newer cities like Columbus) \u0026ndash; no open windows in which to place orders, and fewer orders offered to shoppers.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s It Mean For Me? Columbus is a small market. It literally just launched three months ago, and after the initial launch, there hasn\u0026rsquo;t been a whole heck of a lot of marketing around here. As a result, there\u0026rsquo;s only a small, albeit rather loyal set of customers, and not much in the way of new customers. Some areas have more people and possibly more new customers, but overall, there aren\u0026rsquo;t that many.\nI relied on that loyal customer base, though. Very often, I\u0026rsquo;d get the same half a dozen or so people, with one or two \u0026ldquo;strays\u0026rdquo; (of people to whom I don\u0026rsquo;t often, if ever, deliver), and I had a rather steady income of around $100/week. It\u0026rsquo;s not a lot, by any stretch, but it was enough to fund my HSA account and my soap business. It was literally the difference between crashing at a hotel in Cincinnati this past Friday night for a craft show on Saturday and getting up at 5am to drive down there. So no, not a lot, but enough.\nNow, as a result of the recent changes, the number of orders I\u0026rsquo;m offered has reduced dramatically. This is in no small part due the fact that there are days and times when I\u0026rsquo;m the only one on the schedule (there need to be at least two on schedule in order for the window to be open to taking orders). I\u0026rsquo;ve gone from 6-10 orders a week to as low as 1. If I get more, it\u0026rsquo;s usually because I\u0026rsquo;ve picked up orders elsewhere in the city, but even that is drying up, and both the shoppers and the customers enter a sort of \u0026ldquo;death spiral\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; no one orders, because there\u0026rsquo;s no one to shop the order, and no one shops orders, because no one orders.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Going To Happen Going Forward? I\u0026rsquo;m going to hang on to Shipt for a while, yet. The flexibility can\u0026rsquo;t really be beat, though I am starting to seriously consider Lyft, especially since I\u0026rsquo;m not far from the airport, can work in the evenings, and could feasibly make a fair bit. I\u0026rsquo;d like to try to ride out these bumps in the road and continue to provide feedback to the company. They have a great model and concept, but their execution just needs some work.\nSo What\u0026rsquo;s Going On? I can\u0026rsquo;t really say specifically without risking the terms of my employment contract with them, but that\u0026rsquo;s exactly it \u0026ndash; they are very opaque about just about everything. This most recent policy change was clearly something that was in the works for months and included technological changes that were implemented upwards of six weeks prior. At the time of implementation, we were assured that it was just for statistical purposes and it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t affect the offer algorithm \u0026ldquo;anytime soon.\u0026rdquo; Well, apparently, \u0026ldquo;anytime soon\u0026rdquo; is code for \u0026ldquo;within the next month,\u0026rdquo; because about six weeks later, they gave us a \u0026ldquo;head\u0026rsquo;s up\u0026rdquo; that it was going to start factoring into the offer algorithm.\nStarting that following Monday.\nThat was two weeks ago.\nThere was supposed to be a follow-up providing more information. That follow-up has yet to come.\nThis has, unfortunately, been a pattern for the company, and it\u0026rsquo;s only going to get worse as they grow (since they plan on adding something like 100 cities this year; or that was their goal at our launch). I even called them out on this lack of communication and transparency, and was met with the typical \u0026ldquo;we try to be as transparent as possible\u0026rdquo; corporate-esque answer. It\u0026rsquo;s great that they \u0026ldquo;try,\u0026rdquo; but as Yoda put it so aptly, \u0026ldquo;No. Try not. Do\u0026hellip;or do not. There is no try.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd it can be done. Buffer does it. Yep, it\u0026rsquo;s hard. Yep, it\u0026rsquo;s scary. I can pretty much guarantee those folks will say they and their company are better for it, though. Hell, they\u0026rsquo;re not new at it, they\u0026rsquo;ve been going strong with it for over 5 years. Since they recently bought Respondly, it\u0026rsquo;s clearly working for them. And they are transparent about everything. Everyone\u0026rsquo;s salaries, open source code, even projects that ultimately end up getting scrapped. It\u0026rsquo;s all there for the whole world to see.\nIt sure as hell would help us shoppers out if we better understood the roadmap that this recent change is supposed to be the first step for. As it stands, we\u0026rsquo;re just getting a bunch of stuff that impact our ability to make ourselves and the company money, and told \u0026ldquo;trust us,\u0026rdquo; while getting no information, or worse \u0026ndash; incomplete information.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, this job was never intended to be a \u0026ldquo;career\u0026rdquo; for me. It\u0026rsquo;s most definitely a stepping stone. A means to an end (that end being my own business). However, I was expecting it to last longer. Regardless of how I feel about how the company is handling its growth (both actual and planned), if I can\u0026rsquo;t make money \u0026ndash; especially for reasons beyond my control \u0026ndash; then I\u0026rsquo;m forced to look elsewhere.\n","date":"Apr 18, 2016","description":"It Starts...","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2016/04/18/being-a-shiptster-three-months-in/","series":null,"subtitle":null,"tags":["something different","shipt"],"title":"Being A Shiptster, Three Months In"},{"categories":["finance"],"contents":"I could have sworn I wrote earlier about how one of the things I was planning on doing was personal finance and money-making outside of a typical 9-5. Oh well, if I haven\u0026rsquo;t said it before, I\u0026rsquo;ll say it now \u0026ndash; I find it annoying that there seems to be a gap between \u0026ldquo;flat broke with zero personal finance knowledge\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;personal finance guru,\u0026rdquo; and I\u0026rsquo;d like to bridge that gap, while I\u0026rsquo;m crossing it.\nWhere Did I Start? Okay, admittedly, I haven\u0026rsquo;t been at the \u0026ldquo;zero knowledge\u0026rdquo; point for quite some time. My college degrees included courses in accounting, and I grew up dirt poor, so I\u0026rsquo;m no stranger to finances in general. However, as I\u0026rsquo;m reading books like Rich Dad, Poor Dad and other \u0026ldquo;grow your non-job income\u0026rdquo; type of books and articles, I\u0026rsquo;ve found them to be really freaking vague on the details of getting \u0026ldquo;from broke and homeless\u0026rdquo; to buying that first investment property or other financial milestone. I suspect part of it is simply because, by the time they\u0026rsquo;ve written about it, it\u0026rsquo;s already years in the past, and they\u0026rsquo;ve simply forgotten all the details of which a new person is forced to become completely aware. So, the first step, then, is to start writing about it now, while I\u0026rsquo;m still activelly doing things, and while it\u0026rsquo;s still fresh in my mind.\nRewind, Back To The Beginning Of Q4, 2015 In the fall of 2015, my husband and I both found ourselves burnt out at our jobs. For him, he\u0026rsquo;d finally had it working at what many in his industry call \u0026ldquo;a meatgrinder,\u0026rdquo; because of the disconnect between the main corporation and its values and the IT \u0026ldquo;branch\u0026rdquo; of things. For me, as I\u0026rsquo;ve written about already, I just got burnt out in general. The end result was that neither of us could continue working in our respective positions.\nPart of the agreement for me opting out of the conventional workforce, was that I took over the household finances. Prior to this, my husband managed it. Unfortunately, due to the level of stress he was enduring at work, he had allowed the finances to fall by the wayside. Additionally, because his new job was through a contracting company, and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t working at all, we had to find our own health insurance coverage.\nWhat I inherited:\nThree open credit cards with balances Nearly every bill was at least late, if not a month or more past due (including the mortgage) Half of the bills on autopay, with no savings to speak of to prevent overdrafting A new, upcoming bill for nearly $700/month total (premium + copay/deductible) Half the income with which to fix it all, which fell about $700 short of the full financial requirement Step 1: Write Everything Down The very first thing I did was create a Google Spreadsheet, wrote down the name of the bill, the day of the month that it\u0026rsquo;s due, the amount to pay (average for variable bills like gas and electric), and any notes about it (whether it\u0026rsquo;s on autopay, whether it\u0026rsquo;s a special financing deal, whether it\u0026rsquo;s weird and is billed quarterly, whether it\u0026rsquo;s overdue and by how much, etc). I then sorted them by the due date and applied some conditional formatting to highlight the ones with due dates within certain time frames, so that I can see at a glance whether something\u0026rsquo;s coming due or whether I need to pay it right now.\nIn a new sheet in the file, I created a primitive \u0026ldquo;cash flow\u0026rdquo; sheet. On there, I put down the weekly income we were expecting from my husband\u0026rsquo;s new job, assuming 40 hours (he\u0026rsquo;s hourly now, but generally gets 40+ hours). I also aggregated the payment amounts from the first page of the file, and added rows for additional, non-bill expenses. You know, things like food, gas, savings, etc. Then, it all gets mathed together (income-(bills+expenses)) and I see where I come out at the end of the month (again, with a little conditional formatting to go red when expenses \u0026gt; income and green when expenses \u0026lt; income). I will tell you right now, the first couple of months of that were not pretty. The company hubby was contracted to being closed several days over the holiday (closed company == no pay for hubby) didn\u0026rsquo;t help matters, especially since he was still training, so he didn\u0026rsquo;t have anything to do while his trainer wasn\u0026rsquo;t there.\nStep 2: Create A Payoff Plan On a third sheet in the file (my file actually has 7 sheets in it, though a couple are defunct or only for calculation purposes), I listed out all of the bills that were loans/credit cards. This sheet had the name, the current payoff balance, the interest rate, and the minimum payment. This included all of the credit cards, the car loans, my student loans, and the mortgage. We were fortunate in that most of our stuff has low interest rates and we only had the three cards (two of which had fairly small balances), but it still wasn\u0026rsquo;t particularly pretty. I then imported this debt reduction calculator into my spreadsheet (it was a bit of a pain in the ass, just be warned), to get an idea of what to pay off when, and how long it would take to do so.\nSnowball vs Avalanche There are two common strategies for paying off debts \u0026ndash; the snowball strategy, where you pay the lowest principle, first; and the avalance strategy, where you pay off the highest interest first. They\u0026rsquo;re both the same idea \u0026ndash; you pay as much extra as you can on one bill and only pay the minimum on the others. Once that target bill is paid off, you take the amount you were paying and apply it to the next bill. Either way is extremely powerful, because if I can follow it, I can have what started as over $230k in loans and credit cards paid off in less than 10 years (that includes the house, both cars, and my student loans), and I can be out of credit card debt in less than 5 years, with both cars following shortly thereafter.\nNow, some people say that avalanche is better than snowball, but I don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily agree. I think it greatly depends on what your debt looks like. Avalanche works spectacularly if you have a lot of high-interest credit cards, and your larger debts are relatively low interest. But what if your smaller debts are low interest, interest-free, or at least lower interest than your large debts? If you go the avalanche route, you\u0026rsquo;ll be paying on those little debts for the next several years, while you beat down a large debt. However, if you go the snowball route, you kill those little debts very quickly, freeing up the money to pay off the bigger ones, and/or switch to avalanche once you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with debts that are more similar in length and/or interest rate.\nThe nice thing about the debt calculator I linked earlier, is that you can switch between methods easily and see which one works better for you. For example, for me, the difference is about $90, with no change in the final payoff date (in no small part, because the car loans run out within the next couple of years, anyway), but the snowball method kills all my credit card debt, first, dropping the number of bills to keep track of very quickly.\nStep 3: Find Ways To Reduce Your Bills Immediately Admittedly, the lattes at the local hipster coffee shop were the first thing to go (sorry, Ramit, but our habit was pushing $50/week for the two of us that we legit couldn\u0026rsquo;t afford), but my previous cash flow calculations didn\u0026rsquo;t even include such indulgences (all of which got cut until we could manage the basics), so we needed to find other ways to cut the expenses.\nNow, a number of people may have noticed that I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned cars, plural, and their first thought may be that we should sell one of them. After all, that would immediately knock out a $300-400 payment. Unfortunately, that isn\u0026rsquo;t an option for us, because my son sometimes has behavioral troubles at school, which is over 4 miles away (with no public transportation that connects us, and on a rural route with no sidewalk and barely a shoulder to speak of), and my husband works on the other side of the city (and again, hourly, with no paid time off), so I have to be able to get to the school to pick him up. However, if you\u0026rsquo;re looking to get out of debt or looking for ways to make ends meet, this may be a feasible option for you and is definitely worth considering. We do have the nice advantage of the fact that our car loans are very low interest rate. My car actually has a 0% interest rate (no joke), and my husband\u0026rsquo;s is 2.9%, thanks to some strategic timing on our parts a couple of years ago, and they\u0026rsquo;re both halfway or more through their loans. This makes trading down in order to get a lower payment a bit more limited after interest rates and the reset of the loan are taken into account.\nOne of the first things I did do, though, was put my student loans into forebearance. To be honest, this sucks in the long run, because I owe something like $80k+ with a 6% interest rate, so once I start paying again, it will have tacked on several hundred dollars. However, in the short term, it meant I could make the rest of the ends meet and bought me time to free up money in other areas. There\u0026rsquo;s no easy choice in this situation, sadly.\nOne of the other things to do, too, is to get aggressive about interest rates and monthly payments for things like credit cards and internet/cable/phone bills. We were already pretty pared down when it came to internet/cable (since we cut the cord years ago), but calling the cable company about your bill is a common way of knocking $20+ off your bill (I think we dropped ours by about $50). Talking credit card companies down in interest rates makes paying them off easier, and often gets you a few dollars back, as well. Since the circumstances have changed regarding our cell data usage (we don\u0026rsquo;t have a landline), I\u0026rsquo;ll also be reviewing our account to see if a cheaper plan is viable for our usage (though at the moment, it appears that it would only save us about $5, due to offered plan changes).\nLeverage Windfalls To Pay Off Bills Or Reduce Payments One of the most impactful things I was able to do was leverage the final profit sharing check my husband got from his previous employer, and the income tax check that we received for the previous year. These two windfalls allowed me to pay off the two smallest cards (dropped $3000 of debt, regained over $300/month, and dropped two bills off the schedule). The income tax also allowed me to greatly pay down the \u0026ldquo;equipment installment plan\u0026rdquo; that my cell phone carrier uses for paying for the phones, dropping that bill by nearly $60.\nThis tactic is especially useful if you have several small debts (for example, the two that I paid off were each around $1500).\nStep 4: Build A Bill Paying System The details of how to go about doing this is going to depend on how you pay your bills. All of my bill pay is through my bank, so that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m going to detail here.\nA. Get A Bank That Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Have Account Fees Many banks out there now that don\u0026rsquo;t charge fees for personal checking or savings accounts. I personally really like Ally, because they don\u0026rsquo;t have any fees for having accounts and their customer service has done very well by me. The important part here, though, is no fees for having an account (ideally, unconditionally no fees), because the system I use utilizes several accounts to handle things.\nThe one exception to this is Simple bank, which is built around a single account, but uses a \u0026ldquo;Goal\u0026rdquo; system to organize money. My system works with this kind of interface, and I actually use it extensively, as well. I still recommend a bank that doesn\u0026rsquo;t charge fees for having an account, though, because the bank is already re-investing your money and making 3-4 times the amount you deposit, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to be paying them for that privilege.\nB. Set Up Financial Buckets In my Ally setup, I have a checking account that I call \u0026ldquo;bill pay limbo,\u0026rdquo; which is separate from my \u0026ldquo;income\u0026rdquo;/\u0026ldquo;safe to spend\u0026rdquo; checking account. I did this for a couple of reasons \u0026ndash; 1. Some of the larger bills require saving up money over the course of the month (the joy of having both the mortgage and the health insurance due on the 1st\u0026hellip;), and 2. bill payments don\u0026rsquo;t always get deducted from the balance immediately at my bank, so both of these reduce the cognitive overhead of dealing with the money that\u0026rsquo;s actually there. (Yes, I know how to run a ledger and balance a checkbook. Since I\u0026rsquo;m not the only one withdrawing from the account, I prefer to use the tools the bank provides.)\nI also have two savings accounts. The first is the actual \u0026ldquo;savings\u0026rdquo; account, which is for long-term savings. The goal for this account is to deposit money and not withdraw it until I\u0026rsquo;m ready to invest it somewhere that has a better ROI than a bank savings account. The second account is my \u0026ldquo;buffer\u0026rdquo; account. It\u0026rsquo;s the overdraft protection account that is shared between the income and limbo accounts. The goal there is to have enough to cover bills if/when income falls short. This should have, at minimum, a couple of hundred dollars, but would ideally have enough for a month\u0026rsquo;s worth of bills. Splitting these savings accounts is optional, but I recommend it, so that you can use the savings to grow your wealth in the long run, without impacting your immediate buffer.\nIn my Simple bank setup, Goals take the place of different accounts. I use it to seed my business and fund our HSA account, so I have a couple of permanent goals \u0026ndash; profit, HSA, and taxes. Then, I have other transient goals for various expenses that are incurred over the course of doing business. For a personal account, these goals can be things like \u0026ldquo;savings,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;bill pay,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;buffer.\u0026rdquo;\nC. Immediately Fill The Buckets (And Automate It, If Possible) The next step is to fill those buckets, ideally automatically (if possible). For example, every Friday (weekly pay), I have $430 transfer to bill pay limbo, and $10 to savings. I get this number by adding up the entire month\u0026rsquo;s of bills that have a due date and dividing by the number of paychecks per month.\n(Confession: that amount is only the minimum required to pay health insurance and mortgage for me, I then manually move an additional $400 or so to the bill pay, this is because hubby is hourly, and it\u0026rsquo;s happened a few times that he didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough hours to break $800. However, if you\u0026rsquo;re salary, go ahead and calculate how much you need per week to accumulate the amount necessary to pay the bills with due dates.)\nTechnically, Simple has the amounts automated, but it\u0026rsquo;s a daily transfer, which I don\u0026rsquo;t really like. So, I just do this manually. Each week, I go in and move the money to each of the buckets. On this one, I actually keep the \u0026ldquo;safe to spend\u0026rdquo; at 0, because everything gets earmarked (this is a little more difficult to do in the Ally setup, because things like food and gas vary so much).\nWhat this does is earmark your money, so that you\u0026rsquo;re less likely to spend it on impulse buys and can better create (and stick to) a budget. It also ensures your bills get paid.\nD. View What You\u0026rsquo;re Actually Paying During The Month I\u0026rsquo;m a fan of Wave, since it\u0026rsquo;s free for personal and very small business use and includes a personal section for personal finances. However, Mint and other personal finance software works, too, and Simple has this built in. The important part here is that your transacations are all categorized, so that you can see what you spend where each month. This helps you find where things can be trimmed, as well as where you\u0026rsquo;re spending less than you think. I come back to my Wave account at least once a month to ensure that I\u0026rsquo;m still spending the amounts I expect, and I\u0026rsquo;m not getting spending creep anywhere.\nWhere I Am Now, And The Future I\u0026rsquo;ve done all this for the past several months, and have now paid off two cards, gotten us a little breathing room for some modest social spending (ie \u0026ndash; dinner out a couple of times a month with friends or family), and am poised to start aggressively paying down the biggest credit card. At some point, I\u0026rsquo;ll need to reactivate my student loans, but that\u0026rsquo;s a bridge I won\u0026rsquo;t need to cross until next year. In the meantime, I can grow my own income and work on paying down our debts. The goal I\u0026rsquo;d like to reach by January is enough income to be able to also cover the student loans.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re just starting on the road to financial recovery, rest assured that you can get yourself out of debt. It takes time, and it seems daunting as hell at first, but it can be done. Just take it one step at a time, one day at a time, and once you get started, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to build momentum on your way to being debt free. :)\n","date":"Apr 4, 2016","description":"The chronicles of the journey from a boatload of debt and dependence on a 9-5 to (hopefully) financial independence.","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2016/04/04/getting-started-with-personal-finance/","series":"financial independence","subtitle":"From $700 Shy To $200 Spare In Under 6 Months","tags":["tips","debt"],"title":"Getting Started With Personal Finance"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"Hey-o! This is a really old post and no longer reflects what I do. I ended up going back to software development in October of that year. It was a nice break, but unfortunately, 2016 was also the year gig economy jobs as a whole kind of took a dump. This is here for posterity, though, to avoid broken links. Be sure to read the update\nYes, this is basically what I do, minus the mess.\n(gif credit goes to MisterNistal on imgur) Last night, I hit deliverly number 9 with Shipt. One more, and I open up the ability to shop multiple orders at once (this is huge, because it increases the per-hour rate that I can make). Woot!\nI also made $100 last week. Not bad for half a dozen deliveries over three days, and the first week of a newly-launched platform.\nSo, What\u0026rsquo;s It Like? It\u0026rsquo;s a lot more fun than I expected. I think it\u0026rsquo;s in large part due to the fact that I am once again on the front lines of helping people. It\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;ve come to realize that I missed. It actually outweighs the frustration I used to feel at going grocery shopping, especially during \u0026ldquo;rush\u0026rdquo; time (which is something I\u0026rsquo;ve also noticed a marked decrease since going on hiatus from programming work).\nYou see, there are two prime demographics for Shipt: busy moms, and the disabled. You\u0026rsquo;d be amazed at how quickly the older folks have jumped on this opportunity, since it\u0026rsquo;s primarily on an app or website. Out of the 7 unique customers I\u0026rsquo;ve had so far, 4 were disabled older people who were otherwise mostly or completely incapable of going grocery shopping. To see their faces light up when I arrive with their groceries is spectacular, because you just know it has made their lives better in untold ways.\nHow\u0026rsquo;s The Shopping Part Work? The customer side is pretty straightforward \u0026ndash; the customer peruses the online \u0026ldquo;store,\u0026rdquo; selects the items they want to order and in what quantities, and selects the delivery window that\u0026rsquo;s available for them. They submit their order and wait, when it\u0026rsquo;s delivered, they pay for the delivery in the app, where they also have the option to tip the delivery person (or they can tip them in cash or even in non-cash items; I know one shopper who got tipped in bacon!).\nBut how does it work on the shopper side? And how does the system ensure someone\u0026rsquo;s available to fulfill an order?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s pretty ingenious, really. Shoppers have to do two things to make themselves available to the system \u0026ndash; they have to set their service area(s) and they have to set what delivery windows they\u0026rsquo;re available to run.\nCity Division The metro area is divided into \u0026ldquo;zones,\u0026rdquo; or service areas the shopper can commit to serving. These zones run roughly along the suburb/district lines. So, for example, Gahanna, New Albany, and Hilliard are each their own zones. Some of the suburbs are combined into one zone, though. Blacklick, Whitehall, and Reynoldsburg are combined into one zone. How they came up with them, I\u0026rsquo;m not totally sure, except maybe through average order size data combined with geographical size of the service area and location of the store that will serve the area. As far as I can tell, though, it\u0026rsquo;s been working out pretty well.\nShoppers then set their default zones. They can select one or more, and it\u0026rsquo;s encouraged to set up to three, which gives a good range for most cities (especially here in Columbus). Mine, therefore, are Gahanna, New Albany, and Blacklick/Whitehall/Reynoldsburg zones, since they\u0026rsquo;re all easily accessible from my home. I know a couple of people who have Worthington, New Albany, and Gahanna, so there\u0026rsquo;s some good overlap of coverage, ensuring availability in most areas.\nTime Availability Then, there\u0026rsquo;s the time aspect. As I mentioned in my previous post, shoppers are in full control over their hours. This is done by setting up the time availability in the schedule. It\u0026rsquo;s encouraged to set times at least 24 hours in advance, so that people can order the day before if they choose. Shoppers setting their schedule up is the key to open delivery windows for the customers; they only get a given window option if shoppers have put themselves into the schedule for that zone and that time (I believe it has to be at least two shoppers for a given window in order to be available).\nThe time is for the delivery window, though, which is an important distinction. Shoppers need to remember to build time in for the actual shopping when considering their availability. I, for example, am available from 1pm to about 4pm on weekdays (while my son\u0026rsquo;s in school), so I set my availability to the 2-3 and 3-4 windows, so I can be shopping during the 1 o\u0026rsquo;clock hour.\nThen What? Then, the shopper app (which is different from the customer app) alerts the available shopper that there\u0026rsquo;s an order waiting to be claimed. The system prevents \u0026ldquo;fights\u0026rdquo; between shoppers by only offering an order to one shopper at a time (based in part on rank) for a 60-second window per shopper. If the shopper does not claim the order, it moves on to the next available shopper.\nWhat Happens If No One Picks It Up? In some cases, none of the scheduled shoppers take the order in time for one reason or another. It\u0026rsquo;s then opened up to anyone in the city that\u0026rsquo;s scheduled for that time block. These are known as \u0026ldquo;metro available orders.\u0026rdquo; The metro orders are kind of like a \u0026ldquo;free for all\u0026rdquo; bucket. Anyone can grab them. This is step two in preventing orders from going unfulfilled. I\u0026rsquo;ve done this twice, now. My very first order was a metro one, in fact. I picked another one up earlier this afternoon.\nAnd what happens if an order still goes unclaimed? Then it gets a bounty if it\u0026rsquo;s close to the order\u0026rsquo;s delivery window. The bounty goes up the closer to or farther past the start of the delivery window the order gets (the bounty is useful for making up for the fact that the customer is not likely to add a tip to the order, since it\u0026rsquo;s not the bounty-hunter\u0026rsquo;s fault that it\u0026rsquo;s late). The order is also forgiven for being delivered late, so the shopper does not get the late order marked against them.\nSpeaking Of Late Orders, How Are Shoppers Encouraged To Be On Time? Well, aside from the fact that late deliveries mean no tips and a customer that\u0026rsquo;s less likely to return (fewer repeat orders = less money), it also affects the shopper\u0026rsquo;s system rating. Orders are offered to shoppers in an automated order based on their experience (the number of shops they\u0026rsquo;ve done), their rating (the average rating from customer feedback), and the percentage of deliveries that are on time.\nIn short, if you do a poor job, you get fewer orders offered to you. Fewer orders equals less money.\nBut What About Those Bounties? How Do They Stop People From Letting It Go To Bounty? For one, it plays off the fact that a lot of people who take this kind of job don\u0026rsquo;t like seeing open orders, because open orders mean incomplete work and potentially unhappy customers. :D\nAside from that, putting oneself in the schedule and not accepting offered orders when you have no other orders affects your system rating, and if it is too chronic, you will be taken off the schedule. Also, a happy customer means they\u0026rsquo;re more likely to tip better, and that better tip may be higher than the bounty.\nSo What About Pay, And How Does Shipt Make Money? Shipt, as a company, puts a small markup on the products it sells, just like any reseller. I\u0026rsquo;m not privvy to the details on the markup, but the company says it averages out to about an additional $5 on a $35 order. For the stores that have a loyalty card that affects price (such as Kroger), they base their prices on the loyalty card price and shoppers use a loyalty card at checkout (yes, that means extra fuel points for shoppers).\nShoppers get paid an amount based off the order size. Right now, it\u0026rsquo;s $5 + 7.5% of the order total + tips. According to my stats in the app, and including the cash tips (which the app stats doesn\u0026rsquo;t know about), that has averaged out for me around $16-18 per order.\nWhat? That\u0026rsquo;s Not Much. You\u0026rsquo;re right, that\u0026rsquo;s not a lot per order, especially when you factor taxes in (it\u0026rsquo;s a 1099 contract, so you\u0026rsquo;re in charge of your own taxes), which brings your \u0026ldquo;take home\u0026rdquo; pay down to 70% of that, or about $12 per order. Orders generally take about 1-2 hours for total completion, so that\u0026rsquo;s about $8-9 per hour. Better than minimum wage (for now), but still not great. It certainly isn\u0026rsquo;t a developer\u0026rsquo;s salary, that\u0026rsquo;s for sure.\nHowever, once you\u0026rsquo;ve done 10 orders, the system allows you to book multiple orders per delivery window. So, you shop more than one order at once, which makes your efficiency skyrocket, effectively giving you a raise that\u0026rsquo;s unheard of in the corporate world. Taking a second order can net you half again as much or even double (they recommend combining small orders or a big and a small order, two big orders can be a bit too unweildy unless you\u0026rsquo;re really experienced). It\u0026rsquo;s a bit crazy, logistically, but there are experienced shoppers who routinely do four orders at once. Assuming they get the same $18 per order payout, that becomes $72 per shopping trip, or $36 per hour for a two-hour outing. Now that\u0026rsquo;s a pretty good rate for what this is (if you assume an average of 20 billable hours a week, which is rather conservative in the busy areas, that works out to a little over $37k a year, not shabby for a part time gig).\nAnd You Have To Do Your Own Taxes? It\u0026rsquo;s a 1099 contract, so yeah. However, you can write so much off, it\u0026rsquo;s not even funny. Your mileage, anything you buy to support it (like market carts, foldable wagons, or any kind of marketing materials), it can all be written off on your taxes as business expenses. I highly recommend learning about how business expense type stuff work and consider getting an accountant to help you out, and whether or you get an accountant or not, be sure to sign up on something like Expensify to keep track of your expenses, so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to hoard paper receipts all year.\nOkay, I\u0026rsquo;ve Been Long-Winded Enough I could actually keep talking about it and how it works for the next couple of hours, but there\u0026rsquo;s quite a bit here as it is. It\u0026rsquo;s a ton of fun, and if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a side-gig with flexible hours, it\u0026rsquo;s definitely worth looking into.\nOh, and if you\u0026rsquo;d like to be a customer, click here to sign up through the website or sign up in the app and enter promo code \u0026ldquo;SHAUNAGORDON\u0026rdquo; to get $10 in free groceries. How cool is that?\n(If you\u0026rsquo;re not currently in a Shipt service area, don\u0026rsquo;t fret! They\u0026rsquo;re looking to add 100 new cities this year, so it\u0026rsquo;s worth stopping back to see if they\u0026rsquo;ve launched in your city, or sending them an email to see if they have an ETA. You can also sign up to be alerted when Shipt will be launching in your city.)\n","date":"Jan 13, 2016","description":"","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2016/01/13/a-week-of-shipt/","series":null,"subtitle":"(What It's Like To Be A Shiptster)","tags":["something different","shipt"],"title":"A Week Of Shipt"},{"categories":["tech"],"contents":"Hey-o! There have been some changes made to this process. Be sure to check out the updates.\nThis is actually the second time I\u0026rsquo;ve leveraged Travis CI for managing my static-site blog, but apparently I didn\u0026rsquo;t write about it. I had done it shortly after setting up the Octopress version of my blog. It was nice and convenient, and dramatically lowered the barrier to writing more blog entries, though I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize that until I lost that capability when I switched to Pelican (probably because the Octopress version was a bit finicky, due to breaking changes in the upstream Octopress repo, so the barrier was still pretty high).\nBut then I switched to Pelican, which was infinitely less finicky\u0026hellip;once I got it initially set up.\nThe Downfall Of Static Site Generators As the name suggests, at some point, you have to actually generate your site when you use a generator. For a while, I was just doing this on my computer, which was okay until my hard drive died and I had to reinstall my operating systems. At that point, I procrastinated horribly about updating my blog.\nI do have to hand it to the Ruby guys \u0026ndash; the almost mandatory use of Gemfiles is a godsend (this type of thing is a habit I\u0026rsquo;m very glad the PHP community has picked up and run with, too). Apparently, pip actually does have a similar feature, but use of such files does not seem to be emphasized nearly as much in the Python world, at least not that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen (I had to specifically search for \u0026ldquo;python gemfile equivalent\u0026rdquo; to find that link, because I sincerely didn\u0026rsquo;t know if such a thing existed). Not having such a file makes setting up an environment for an existing Python app/site/blog a bit\u0026hellip;painful. What dependencies did I have? What were they named? What are the gotchas I have to worry about (I know there were some, but what were they?!)? I\u0026rsquo;ve since added a requirements.txt file to my blog source, but not knowing that such a thing existed proved a hindrance to my blogging. If nothing else, it\u0026rsquo;s a nice reference to what needs to be installed for my blog.\nI\u0026rsquo;d also still have to remember the commands needed to build it, and I\u0026rsquo;d have to set up my repositories again in the way that I had it. I was lazy about it at one point, and had them separate repos, but that\u0026rsquo;s awkward as hell. So, a couple of weeks ago, I decided to clean house and set it up so that I only need to push new posts to a particular branch of my repo, and automation would do the rest.\nGithub — The Static-Site Dream Host So, first things first, we need a place from which to host our blog. Since the output is entirely html, it can really be hosted anywhere, but for this setup, we use Github\u0026rsquo;s Pages feature. If you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with Github Pages (you must have been living under a rock), it\u0026rsquo;s an easy way to host small websites, simply by designating them as such from a Github repo. Awesome, right? Right.\nThere are two ways to do this:\nHave a gh-pages branch in your project repo. This is known as a \u0026ldquo;project site\u0026rdquo; and is most commonly used for little landing pages for open source projects. Have a dedicated [username].github.io repository (or the legacy [username].github.com). This is known as a \u0026ldquo;user\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;organization\u0026rdquo; page and is common for user blogs and aggregate showcases of a user\u0026rsquo;s or organization\u0026rsquo;s repo. This blog uses this method. The cool thing about Github Pages is that you can also use custom domains, and like the rest of the hosting, it\u0026rsquo;s completely free. That\u0026rsquo;s how my blogs use my domain, instead of the Github one. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to set up, too.\nStep 1: Set Up The Repo If you\u0026rsquo;re doing a user/org site, then you\u0026rsquo;ll need a repo named [username].github.io. In these sites, the master branch will be the branch that holds the generated HTML. If you\u0026rsquo;re doing a project site, then you can use any repo you want, but you\u0026rsquo;ll need to add a gh-pages branch. The gh-pages branch will be the one with the generated HTML. From here on out, we\u0026rsquo;ll call it the display branch.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll also need branch to hold the ungenerated source (themes, plugins, markdown files, etc). I use the master branch on my health blog, and a \u0026ldquo;source\u0026rdquo; branch on my main blog. It ultimately doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter what the branch name is, but we\u0026rsquo;ll call it the source branch, here.\nIf you want to use a custom domain, you\u0026rsquo;ll also want to be sure to include a CNAME file with the name (in my case, it contains just \u0026ldquo;shaunagordon.com\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;health.shaunagordon.com\u0026rdquo; in the relevant repos), and of course, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to point your nameservers to Github.\nStep 2: Set Up Travis Some of the settings in this section have changed, be sure to read the update!\nFor the purpose of this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll assume you\u0026rsquo;ve set up your Pelican blog at least once, to ensure it works and displays as expected. I just fired up a Vagrant box to handle this, that way I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to clutter up my host system with a bunch of Python dependencies that I only use for generating my blogs (which I\u0026rsquo;ll no longer be doing locally). We\u0026rsquo;ll tweak it later, but if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a basic set up done yet, go do that now.\nOnce your repo is set up, the most basic level of setting up Travis is as simple as adding a .travis.yml file and logging in to Travis with your Github account and telling it to watch your repo. We need to tell it what to actually do, though. Pelican makes this pretty easy, since its Makefile handles the actual compilation and deployment. This boils the .travis.yml file down to this:\nNifty, right?\nBut Wait, What\u0026rsquo;s That \u0026ldquo;Encrypted Travis Key\u0026rdquo; And How Do I Get It? This is something that\u0026rsquo;s been updated. This technique is now outdated.\nIn order to be able to push to your repo once it\u0026rsquo;s built, Travis needs an access token. You get the access token by going to Settings -\u0026gt; Personal Access Tokens and creating a new one with the permissions required by Travis. Storing that access token value in the config file in plain text is insecure, though, because it allows anyone to obtain those rights to your repositories. Not good.\nThe guys at Travis CI were kind enough to provide a command line tool to address this, though. It can easily be installed and the \u0026ldquo;encrypt\u0026rdquo; command run with the following:\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll see there are two options on the encrypt command. --add automatically puts it into your .travis.yml file. The --override command is optional, but useful if you already have a secure key in your .travis.yml file that you want to replace (such as if you didn\u0026rsquo;t generate the key right the first time).\nAnd What About That Requirements File? This could probably be refined, but this should get you started. I simply ran pip freeze \u0026gt; requirements.txt, which gave me a list like this:\nMy Vagrant box did have a few things in it that failed in Travis, so I had to remove them. Just remove any lines that appear distribution-specific, and tweak from there based on Travis errors. Alternatively, if you know exactly what packages you installed, then you can include just those. I kind of like it a little more verbose, though.\nStep 3: Tweak Pelican This is something that\u0026rsquo;s been updated. This technique is now outdated. Travis was kind enough to build this in!\nPelican includes a nice little Github command within the Makefile, but it\u0026rsquo;s designed more for running it locally, with credentials for the Github account. That\u0026rsquo;s not really a good idea for a Travis deploy. So, we adjust the Makefile command so that Travis can push to the repo:\nWhat this does is use the ghp-import tool to deploy the compiled site to Github, to the branch specified by GITHUB_PAGES_BRANCH. This allows us to use any branch we choose to be our deploy branch.\nThen, we want to tweak Pelican\u0026rsquo;s config files. The publishconf.yml file is most important here, but it\u0026rsquo;s useful to keep pelicanconf.yml synchronized, too. We need to make sure we have a .travis.yml file and our CNAME file in the finished output. The .travis.yml file needs only one directive \u0026ndash; ignore the output branch. Otherwise, Travis will try to build it, too, when it updates. We don\u0026rsquo;t want that.\nSo, what we do is add an \u0026ldquo;extras\u0026rdquo; folder if the project doesn\u0026rsquo;t yet have one, and drop in a travis.yml file and a CNAME file, then let Pelican know to copy them into the compiled site, like so:\nNow, you should be ready to go!\n(The Travis setup was done with the help of Mathieu Leplatre\u0026rsquo;s post, though I\u0026rsquo;ve made some modifications, such as the extra commands.)\nStep 4: Deploy And Blog! Not that you\u0026rsquo;re all set up, you should be able to start writing blog entries in your favorite Pelican-supported text format. Just save your blog entry in the \u0026ldquo;content\u0026rdquo; folder, commit it in git and push to your source folder in GitHub. Travis will pick up that the source branch changed, build the updated site, and deploy to your deploy branch. Woot!\n","date":"Jan 13, 2016","description":"","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2016/01/13/pelican-travis-and-github/","series":null,"subtitle":"Setting Up Autmated Blog Updates","tags":["blog","tips","automation","continuous integration"],"title":"Pelican, Travis, and Github"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"What\u0026rsquo;s This Strengths Finding Thing? I\u0026rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of podcasts lately. I\u0026rsquo;m particularly a fan of Smart Passive Income and Screw The Nine To Five. They\u0026rsquo;re both great podcasts for learning about how to build your own business in order to generate income that\u0026rsquo;s not dependent on trading your time for money. They\u0026rsquo;re a gold mine of various resources, not just for starting and running one\u0026rsquo;s own business, but for business and life stuff in general.\nOne such resource is the Strengths Finding concept. I first heard about it on the SPI podcast with Michael Hyatt Pat was talking with Michael about how he hires employees, and one of the things his guest mentioned was that he read Tom Rath\u0026rsquo;s StrengthsFinder 2.0, took the StrengthsFinder test, and had all his current and future employees take the test. He then uses the results to help determine how to fill out the team. By using it, he can be sure to find people with different strengths, to help ensure his team\u0026rsquo;s well-rounded and varied, and avoid filling it up with a bunch of the same type of people.\nIt was a really cool idea, I thought, and so I sought out the StrengthsFinder book. They didn\u0026rsquo;t have a Kindle version when I had Christmas money, so I ended up not getting the book, itself. At the time, I instead favored picking up a few other books (namely, Rich Dad, Poor Dad, and a couple others that I will talk about in a future post), which were available on Kindle. I poked around the idea of the StrengthsFinder test, but didn\u0026rsquo;t really know or see that there were similar tests out there. So, I set the idea aside for a while.\nThen, I was listening to the Screw podcast, and the hosts of it also talked about the Strengths Finding test, but had pointed to a different one. Okay, cool, there are more, comparable tests out there. Awesome. Well, the one they refer to also costs money I don\u0026rsquo;t currently have, but knowing that there are others out there gives me a little more confidence in the alternative ones. Let\u0026rsquo;s check it out!\nThe Test Results So, I found a different, though somewhat similar test that was free and took it. The results were neat, though not entirely unexpected. So! My top 5 strengths are:\nFaith (100%) Curiosity (94%) Integrity (94%) Determination (94%) Teamwork (88%) The runners up include Adaptability, Problem Solving, Innovation, and Leadership at 81%; and Risk Taking, Ambition, Optimism, and Communication at 75%. My biggest weakness \u0026ndash; and by a pretty large margin of nearly 20% from the other lowest-listed items \u0026ndash; is salesmanship.\nThe Meaning Let\u0026rsquo;s face it, these kinds of tests are essentially glorified, slightly more in-depth Myers Briggs tests, and are about as vague. However, they can be useful for putting into black and white one\u0026rsquo;s various traits to use for further analysis and exploration. The intention of these kinds of tests are to harness the strengths and use them to one\u0026rsquo;s advantage, instead of focusing on the weaknesses and spending all of one\u0026rsquo;s time and energy on trying to improve shortcomings.\nThe test results provide some more information on what each heading means, at least for the top 5 and bottom 1. Some of the key takeaways for me were:\nMake efforts to discover your true passion and tie it to your work, no matter what you do. Let others know that you give more value to levels of service than to money. Actively take on roles that require you to stay current in a fast moving field. Track your learning and progress and celebrate every milestone. Work beside someone who will push you to learn more. Learn by teaching others. Do not be forced to rush and sacrifice quality. You value quality first, help others understand this. Protect yourself from taking on too much. Learn to say \u0026ldquo;no.\u0026rdquo; Constantly be on the lookout for new goals and improvements. You\u0026rsquo;re good at initiating and organizing a project. Start your own and help others. You are loyal, place a high value on trust, and will not betray people - be the person people can come to. Build genuine trusting relationships with critical people you want around. Generosity is a strength - be aware, get noticed, and keep it up.\nWhat I also find interesting is the relationship between the traits of my \u0026ldquo;strengths\u0026rdquo; and those of my \u0026ldquo;weakness.\u0026rdquo; According to the test, the Salesmanship type prefers loose, casual, broad relationships over the more close, personal relationships of the Integrity and Teamwork types. In a single person, this difference is, of course, pretty much mutually exclusive. In a team environment, though, both become highly important, even within the same team.\nThis is also where the authors of these kinds of tests \u0026ndash; and where Michael Hyatt \u0026ndash; has a good point when they say to focus on building on one\u0026rsquo;s strengths, and where this point comes into sharp relief. My strengths and weakness are at odds with one another \u0026ndash; salesmanship does not by any stretch come naturally to me. I much prefer a few close relationships over a bunch of casual ones, and this is reflected in the relationships that I form while working for a given company, where I tend to be very close to a couple of people, and the rest of the company are essentially unknown to me. Now, I can work on overcoming this weakness, and doing so can help my career, certainly (there\u0026rsquo;s a reason I\u0026rsquo;ve joined Shipt as a shopper) but attempting to focus on this over my strengths takes a toll on me that prevents me from being able to do the things I\u0026rsquo;m best at, so I need to be careful to not try to focus on \u0026ldquo;fixing\u0026rdquo; my weak points at the expense of nurturing my strengths.\nFinal Thoughts This is definitely a useful tool to actually put down onto \u0026ldquo;paper\u0026rdquo; different aspects of oneself. I can see it being a springboard for further introspection and analysis, to help put into black and white our differences and similarities, so that we can build out well-rounded teams.\n","date":"Jan 6, 2016","description":"","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2016/01/06/strengthsfinding/","series":null,"subtitle":"A Different Way To Build Teams","tags":["personal growth","diversity","culture"],"title":"Finding One's Strengths"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"Wait\u0026hellip;what? I traded a lucrative programming career for\u0026hellip;buying and delivering groceries?\nIn short, yes. For now, at least.\nSimply Put \u0026ndash; I Got Burned The F\u0026ndash; Out I left my development job just before Thanksgiving. I all but literally told them \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s not you, it\u0026rsquo;s me,\u0026rdquo; because that was the truth. I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything but good stuff to say about the company I worked for, because they were about as close to perfect as I\u0026rsquo;ve found. They really didn\u0026rsquo;t care about the number of hours you worked, as long as you got the work done. They care about their employees (I went to the upper management a couple of times with some issues, and not only did they listen to what I had to say, they took it seriously and made change in order to fix the underlying problem). They valued employees\u0026rsquo; time and acted accordingly (kept meetings and interruptions to a minimum, had an unlimited paid time off policy, etc). The code, itself, is what burnt me out, really, and even that, had I been able to stick it out, probably would have resolved over time, as we modernized the legacy system.\nUnfortunately, between the system, which was built in a way that was basically opposite to how I think and operate, so I was fighting my own brain the whole time, and various events going on at home, I pretty much crashed and burned. In the last couple of months of working, I became less and less able to do the work, and when I got off of work, I was so mentally exhausted that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t function to do home stuff. It was all I could do to make dinner and put my son to bed in the evenings, let alone work on a side project that would allow me to apply to other companies that might suit me better (I didn\u0026rsquo;t even want to look at computer after getting done with work). So, I made the decision to resign, for both the company\u0026rsquo;s and my own sake.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s now been a little over a month \u0026ndash; a much-needed month off. I\u0026rsquo;m actually getting back to a point where I can function, where the idea of doing just about any kind of work doesn\u0026rsquo;t awash me in anxiety. I can, at the very least, open an editor and work on tech-related stuff, including working on this blog (both writing and hooking it up to Travis CI, so I can add posts from just about anywhere). I hope to be able to start working on actual development projects again in the coming weeks.\nChanging Trajectory One thing I\u0026rsquo;ve wanted to do for some time was run my own business. Since taking time off, I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to focus on growing that part of my life. Right now, I\u0026rsquo;ve focused on getting vendor opportunities for my soap business and craft projects. Over Thanksgiving, I was able to land a good deal with a small, but popular shop near my mom\u0026rsquo;s house. It\u0026rsquo;s actually been keeping me rather busy keeping up, since cold process soap requires a 6-week lead time. I actually need to work on expanding my production and curing stuff. I\u0026rsquo;ve run myself out of room in my current setup!\nIt also uncovered a bit of a pain point in the soap making arena \u0026ndash; the lack of production, inventory, etc. software. There is, as far as I can tell, one option out there, and it leaves quite a bit to be desired in the user experience department. So, I plan on working on an alternative option for it that serves three purposes for me \u0026ndash; 1. it gives me an application to use that has the features I want/need, 2. it provides me with a code sample should I want to go back to working for someone else, and 3. it provides me with a potential source of income once I get it completed and up and running.\nAll of these things are long-game plans, though. It takes time to build an application (especially when you\u0026rsquo;re the only one and you\u0026rsquo;re designing and architecting everything), it takes time to build a vendor/customer list to sell to or through, and it takes time to get the money from those things. Unfortunately, when I quit working, I inherited most of the home-based things, which includes bills that were okay while both my husband and I were working for companies, but made finances tight when one salary dropped off. We\u0026rsquo;re close to living off one salary, but need some extra cash sooner rather than later.\nEnter Shipt As it so happens, a nifty little company out of Birmingham, AL was just about to expand into the Columbus area (in fact, today is launch day). Shipt is an on-demand grocery delivery service. The core company has built a platform where customers use their mobile app to order groceries, and shoppers go buy and deliver the groceries. They employ independent contractors to be the shoppers, though the salaried team at the corporate office also make a point to do at least one shop a month to ensure they don\u0026rsquo;t get disconnected from their core model.\nThey do the contracting right, too \u0026ndash; we set our own hours, limited only by the hours the grocery stores \u0026ndash; and, by extension, Shipt \u0026ndash; are open (they work with particular chains in each area to allow us to shop there, since Shipt is technically a \u0026ldquo;reseller,\u0026rdquo; so there\u0026rsquo;s some paperwork that needs filed), we determine how many hours a day or week we work, we determine how many orders we can take on at once, we can even do our own advertising/marketing and whatnot (as long as we follow the branding guidelines).\nFinally! A source of income I can do while my son is in school in the afternoons (he only goes half-days right now) and when my husband gets off work, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t run me all night, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t require me to do while my son is home (and, therefore, split my energy and force me to multitask by default). It\u0026rsquo;s perfect! Now it\u0026rsquo;s just a matter of picking up the orders so I can actually make money. Still, weekly pay as long as I fulfill at least one order, is still more frequent and more immediate than once every 4-6 weeks, and even more than 6+ months from now. It will definitely help smooth out the inherent rockiness of selling physical products of my own, and provides an avenue for some quick cash when necessary, as well as extra money to invest into building my company. Best of all, it\u0026rsquo;s something that gets me out of the house, which is nice, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t take a ton of brainpower, so it complements my coding work and doesn\u0026rsquo;t interfere with it.\nThe Future I became a developer, because I loved writing code. I loved solving problems by making software. I want to be able to get back to that, because working as a software developer has largely lost sight of that core love of problem solving. Over the past several years, working as a software developer became less about solving people\u0026rsquo;s problems with code, and more about completing tickets and meeting deadlines. Technically, the problem solving was still there \u0026ndash; I last worked on software that was solving problems for people (I actually got to hear sometimes about how a new feature was a lifesaver to a particular client, those were awesome moments) \u0026ndash; but I was thrice removed from those things. By the time it was my time to work, the solutions were dictated to me and expected to be done a certain way (even if the way wasn\u0026rsquo;t always communicated to me).\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not really what I want. I want the code itself to stay largely out of my way, and I want to spend my time coming up with solutions to problems. This is probably why I\u0026rsquo;ve started getting into DevOps type of stuff lately (though, unfortunately, my path into that suffers the same issue my looking for work with other people suffered \u0026ndash; certain requirements needed to be filled, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the energy to fill them in).\nI\u0026rsquo;m hoping that my software project will fulfill that need for me, while still allowing me to keep the software industry a bit more at arms-reach, so I don\u0026rsquo;t get mired in its not-so-pleasant depths again.\n","date":"Jan 6, 2016","description":"","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2016/01/06/from-developer-to-shipt-shopper/","series":null,"subtitle":null,"tags":["something different","shipt"],"title":"From Developer to Shipt Shopper"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"I had an interesting experience recently.\nI had a job opportunity dropped in my lap. A greenfield project that had a pay range $10-40k more than what I\u0026rsquo;m currently making.\nYou have my attention.\nI responded to the recruiter and within a few days, I had an initial meeting/interview with one of the higher-ups at the company.\nI went and had a nice conversation with him. He was a cool person, not much older than myself. The company itself was pretty cool, and looked and acted very much like a Silicon Valley startup. We even sat in a conference room that had a feminism-themed mural on one wall (I was told that each of the conference rooms had mural of different themes, though the other rooms were occupied at the time, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to see much of them). The primary working space sported a handful of colorful market umbrellas (which I later found out served the purpose of shielding some of the employees from the direct sunlight that streamed in from the skylights overhead) interspersed through the three columns of desks.\nI knew going in that it was an open floor plan, but I was still struck at how far this had been taken. The desks had no less than two workstations, each, and the central column was made of long tables that held multiple workstations. The company, for being a relatively young startup (only a couple of years old, though very successful), was larger than I expected.\nAfter the meeting, I realized that while it would be a nice pay raise, and I\u0026rsquo;d get to work on new development instead of the legacy system I currently work with, I really didn\u0026rsquo;t want to go back to an office environment, especially one so open that you don\u0026rsquo;t even get a dedicated desk. I found that the feeling remained even after mulling it over for a few days.\nI also realized just how much I value culture, and how willing I am to put my money where my mouth is.\nI realized that, despite the \u0026ldquo;WTF moments\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ve had with the code that I\u0026rsquo;m currently working with, and despite the fact that this opportunity would have been a nice raise, for the first time in a long time, I have no desire to leave. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to break in new coworkers, especially while trying to write/architect a new system, and trying to do it all in an environment I know isn\u0026rsquo;t conducive to my productivity (not to mention dealing with a suburb-downtown commute each day).\nWhat did this? What makes my current employer so great that I\u0026rsquo;d turn down such a lucrative opportunity? It\u0026rsquo;s simple, really.\nMy higher-ups value my input and concerns and act on them when appropriate.\nI left my previous, agency job, despite all the cool greenfield projects I got to do, because I was treated as nothing more than a code machine. When I tried to make it known that the process seemed broken and maybe there\u0026rsquo;s a better way to do it without abusing the people on the production teams, I was at best ignored and at worst told that since they\u0026rsquo;re better than the competition, they didn\u0026rsquo;t need to improve anything. I had similar experiences with a couple other of my previous jobs.\nIn fact, cultural issues were the reason I left nearly every job that I\u0026rsquo;ve voluntarily left since I started programming.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s how much culture means to me.\nSo, when I find a company that embodies the core values that I have about workplace culture, you can bet I\u0026rsquo;m not going to let go of it lightly.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a \u0026ldquo;fixer\u0026rdquo; by nature. I have what is, for all intents and purposes, a compulsive need to solve problems put before me. So, when I see that the development team is working a bunch of overtime, for example, I immediately ask \u0026ldquo;why?\u0026rdquo; Why are they working so much, and what can we do to make sure they\u0026rsquo;re not being overworked? The company\u0026rsquo;s answer to those questions have proven more valuable than even I imagined it when I first started asking. At previous jobs, the answer would basically be \u0026ldquo;oh, that\u0026rsquo;s just the way things are, work ebbs and flows\u0026rdquo; (funny, it never seemed to ebb enough to work only the hours you tout as a perk of working for you).\nMy current employer, though? The answer is \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;re sorry, your team needs more people. Give us some time, we\u0026rsquo;re working on that.\u0026rdquo; Actually, it\u0026rsquo;s a few different answers. In addition to the aforementioned one, it\u0026rsquo;s also, \u0026ldquo;since it\u0026rsquo;s an older system, a lot of things are done manually that could be scripted, we\u0026rsquo;re looking at what we can do to automate those things, which should free up some time on that end. Feel free to toss any ideas you may have.\u0026rdquo;\nNow, you have my undying loyalty.\nI kid you not, I geek out on DevOps stuff with the CTO on a fairly regular basis. Rarely have I been able to have that kind of relationship with anyone in management positions (even so much as tech leads). Yeah, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to have to rebuild that from scratch again. Thanks, though.\nI think people underestimate the value of this kind of environment. This is what I call real culture. This isn\u0026rsquo;t the superficial crap you see in so many other companies. This isn\u0026rsquo;t beer kegs and video game consoles, dusty with disuse, but nonetheless used as a marketing tool to attract Millenials. This isn\u0026rsquo;t happy hours, meant to look like management cares about its employees at an individual level without actually building relationships with them. I kid you not, I\u0026rsquo;ve worked at offices that have had pool tables, ping pong tables, kegerators, and video game consoles. The beer was the most utilized perk at most of them, and at one job, in the nearly 2 years I was there, I\u0026rsquo;d never seen the tables nor the consoles used for their intended purposes.\nThose aren\u0026rsquo;t perks, those are props.\nAt my current employer, we have none of those. Hell, we don\u0026rsquo;t even have an office (not that that is at all a bad thing). By nature of being a distributed company, we don\u0026rsquo;t have such gatherings (though we do get a \u0026ldquo;Holiday Party In An Envelope,\u0026rdquo; or HPIE for short, which often includes a gift card to a nice restaurant and a few other nerdy goodies). This really isn\u0026rsquo;t as depressing as some people might think, because the focus is then shifted away from these frivolous things (and marketing them) and toward more meaningful things and ways to attract (and keep) employees. The end result is the above \u0026ndash; a company run by people I\u0026rsquo;m comfortable approaching with my concerns and ideas and having them seriously heard and considered, and that I\u0026rsquo;d be hard pressed to leave behind.\n","date":"Jun 15, 2015","description":"","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2015/06/15/when-culture-trumps-everything/","series":null,"subtitle":null,"tags":["culture"],"title":"When Culture Trumps Everything"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"A couple of months ago, I got an invitation to an Amazon recruiting event:\nHi Shauna-\nI came across your information in our system and your background is impressive! We are currently looking to hire Sr. Software Development Engineers (SDEs) to join the Amazon Retail team and are hosting an “Invitation Only” recruiting event for the Amazon Media and International Expansion (ISE) organizations specifically the week of February 16th.\nIf you’re interested in being considered for this opportunity, please reply with your updated resume to [Recruiter\u0026rsquo;s email] if you’d like to be considered. Once we receive your response, we will evaluate your candidacy for consideration for the event.\nThe roles are based in Seattle, WA and Amazon will provide relocation assistance to our hires. Unfortunately, remote work is not an option for these openings.\nWe also value your referrals. Please don’t hesitate to share my information with any of your friends/colleagues who may be interested.\nThanks, [Amazon Recruiter]\nIt was a cool opportunity, but I decided to turn it down. The fact that remote work wasn\u0026rsquo;t even an option was a bit of a red flag for me. No remote option meant my family and I would have to pick up and move to Seattle. While the idea has certainly been tempting (and strangely enough, apparently despite Seattle\u0026rsquo;s reputation for being rainy as hell, Columbus is on par for cloudy days), we\u0026rsquo;d be giving up a lot of things that we have here. I admittedly don\u0026rsquo;t have the greatest track record for job longetivity, and although that hasn\u0026rsquo;t stopped recruiters from knocking on my virtual door, it\u0026rsquo;s something that\u0026rsquo;s at the forefront of my mind any time I consider a new opportunity.\nThe reason my track record is the way it is, is because of company culture. I\u0026rsquo;m very picky about company culture and don\u0026rsquo;t do well in certain cultures that tend to be rampant in companies that need developers (which I\u0026rsquo;ve touched on, a couple of times, before and will probably go into more detail about in a future post). I asked around to see what the culture at Amazon is really like, and what I found was\u0026hellip;eh\u0026hellip; It wasn\u0026rsquo;t bad, per se, but there were a few things I found that weren\u0026rsquo;t good for me, and a lot of \u0026ldquo;it depends.\u0026rdquo;\nSo, I responded like so:\nHi [Recruiter],\nI greatly appreciate your invitation. However, I have chosen to turn down this offer and explain why. I hope you, and Amazon as a whole, will take this into consideration.\nCulture means a lot to me. So much so that for me, it\u0026rsquo;s the \u0026ldquo;kingmaker\u0026rdquo; aspect of a job. I\u0026rsquo;m not talking kegerators and happy hours, or onsite gyms and token video game consoles. I\u0026rsquo;m talking about things like respect for employees\u0026rsquo; time and health (both physical and mental), and I\u0026rsquo;m talking about the behaviors of companies and management that lead to workforces that consist primarily of single, white men in their 20s.\nOne of the big talking points in\u0026hellip;well\u0026hellip;just about everything tech and work related, is \u0026ldquo;why are women leaving the tech industry?\u0026rdquo; or a similar variation, \u0026ldquo;why are developer teams so primarily young, white men?\u0026rdquo; The answer is a lot simpler than people seem to think, in my opinion, though changing it is admittedly not so simple.\nThe leading tech companies breed a culture that only appeals to the bachelor demographic, and the followers try to emulate the leaders.\nWhen I first got your email, I was excited, but I was also hesitant. So, I asked my developer network what it\u0026rsquo;s like working at Amazon, since I knew a few current or former employees were in it.\nBetween those replies and the reviews I saw on various job ranking sites, the answer I got was a solid \u0026ldquo;it depends.\u0026rdquo;\nAmazon, being such a large company, is bound to have different \u0026ldquo;subcultures\u0026rdquo; within its various departments, of course. The red flags for me, though, were along the same lines for why leads for other West Coast companies didn\u0026rsquo;t pan out for me \u0026ndash; the idea that developers are expendable and that running us on the brink of burnout is something to aspire to. Model View Culture had a fantastic write-up about this issue (https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/adderall-has-a-tech-industry-problem), and having seen that expectation for myself, \u0026ldquo;it depends\u0026rdquo; is simply not good enough to warrant picking up my family and moving across the country. While the risk would be lower if I were single, it would still be a large risk that I\u0026rsquo;d be hesitant to take on, because of that \u0026ldquo;it depends,\u0026rdquo; especially since the stories for the \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; end were really bad. Add to that the fact that some of the benefits required paying back if you didn\u0026rsquo;t make it to X number of months or years, and that clinched it so hard I even considered cancelling my Prime membership (since I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I even want to support a company with those kinds of values).\nThe fact that remote work is not offered for most of the developer positions I\u0026rsquo;ve seen offered by Amazon \u0026ndash; this one included \u0026ndash; is an additional issue for me. I\u0026rsquo;ve found that there are other certain cultural traits that often appear in companies that don\u0026rsquo;t allow remote working with which I don\u0026rsquo;t agree. Namely, that the company is still beholden to hours spent in a chair, and risk fostering the \u0026ldquo;turn the lights on in the morning and off at night\u0026rdquo; culture for which developers are already at risk and lends to gross abuses of the Fair Labor Standards Act and salaried developers, both of which are already all too common in our industry.\nAgain, I thank you for the opportunity, but with the information I\u0026rsquo;ve found regarding Amazon\u0026rsquo;s developer culture, I will have to pass.\nShauna Gordon\nIt was a bit long-winded, though not nearly what I\u0026rsquo;ve written in other forums. I was hoping the recruiter would read it and take it into consideration, but honestly, I expected to not hear from them again.\nI was pleasantly surprised to find that wasn\u0026rsquo;t the case (emphasis mine):\nHi Shauna-\nI apologize for the delay in getting back to you, and thank you for sharing your story and giving a detailed description on Amazon. Diversity and culture is something that we have been discussing in our meetings with upper management, and want you to know as not only a candidate but an Amazon customer, we take this issue very seriously. I’ve shared this email with our management and hiring teams so they can have a better understanding of our brand and what our customers think of us as a whole.\nAmazon strives to be the most customer centric company in the world, and I believe it’s of the upmost importance each of us as employees are treating our customer’s right and making sure they are taken care of.\nIf anything should change in the future or anything I can do to improve the situation, please feel free to reach out.\nAll the best, [Recruiter]\nWow. Okay then. That was certainly more than expected, which is cool. Now the real test \u0026ndash; see if anything meaningful come from that action. Only time will tell on that front.\nI\u0026rsquo;m posting this for a couple of reasons:\nTo provide an example of a company (at least appearing to) listen to its candidates and customers. As a long-time Amazon customer, I\u0026rsquo;ve never been disappointed by their customer service, but I\u0026rsquo;ve never had it in writing like this, and this move goes beyond what even their customer service people have done. To sort of help hold Amazon accountable (for lack of a better description) and not let this get lost in a sea of emails. Not that this would really hold much (if any) weight in the grand scheme of things, it might help something, somewhere further the goal of diversity in the workplace and Silicon Valley companies and whatnot. To provide an example of doing one of the things that I advocate \u0026ndash; explaining to companies why I make a given decision about them or their product. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of talk about all the things that are wrong with the tech industry or gaming or the world in general, but it\u0026rsquo;s not often I see actual solutions, suggestions, or even so much as a \u0026ldquo;hey, I contacted this company\u0026rdquo; (and, almost worse, when I do see posts of \u0026ldquo;hey, I contacted this company, here\u0026rsquo;s their response,\u0026rdquo; it\u0026rsquo;s very often only when the response is negative. While that\u0026rsquo;s great for publicity, it\u0026rsquo;s not so great for highlighting the things that have gone right in this world). Hopefully, this won\u0026rsquo;t fall into history as an example of a company making empty promises. Only time will tell.\n","date":"Jun 8, 2015","description":"Or, why culture really matters when considering a cross-country move.","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2015/06/08/an-exchange-with-amazon-on-workplace-culture/","series":null,"subtitle":null,"tags":["culture","diversity"],"title":"An Exchange With Amazon On Workplace Culture"},{"categories":["business","remote work"],"contents":"Since I posted my open letter to recruiters, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen a number of people speaking out against it (\u0026ldquo;against\u0026rdquo; used loosely here, ranging from \u0026ldquo;employees need to be in the office\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;the best companies hire the best people and the best people want to go into the office\u0026rdquo; (that\u0026rsquo;s not insulting at all) to \u0026ldquo;working remotely is isolating\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;in-person communication is better\u0026rdquo;). I decided to address a few of these things head-on.\nRemote Friendly != Remote Only There seems to be an underlying assumption that a remote friendly company is a remote only company \u0026ndash; that employees can only be all remote or all in the office.\nThis is a false dichotomy, though. Being remote friendly does not necessarily mean that being remote is required. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with giving your employees an office they can choose to use. In fact, this is the most feasible option for companies that already have offices, and can be quite a large cost savings to rapidly-growing companies, since they don\u0026rsquo;t have to house all of their employees in their office at any given time. New companies can offer reimbursement on co-working spaces and encourage and allow for geographically close coworkers to find a shared office space if they want to.\nNot everyone is cut out for working remotely, and that\u0026rsquo;s fine. Companies don\u0026rsquo;t have to choose between all their employees being remote and all their employees being in the office. In fact, the point of being remote friendly is that location doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. When location doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, it can still be in an office (and it \u0026ndash; gasp! \u0026ndash; doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter!). Just like it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be all office, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to not be, either. What\u0026rsquo;s important is that the decision is left to the individual employees.\nJacques Woodcock wrote at length about creating a \u0026ldquo;remote ready\u0026rdquo; culture. His entire post is a great read, but this segment is especially relevant to the point I\u0026rsquo;m making here:\nRight now, we’ve setup what I’ve called a remote ready culture. What this means is that we function, with all company processes and procedures, as if we were a remote culture. We just happen to be in the office.\n\u0026ldquo;We just happen to be in the office.\u0026rdquo; His company doesn\u0026rsquo;t require employees to be in the office, nor does it require that they not be in the office. (On a side note, Jacques also provides a great example of how an existing office-required company can transition to being a remote-ready one, which can be a different beast than a company that is remote-ready from its inception.)\nRemote != Isolated For some reason, the idea of working remotely seems to conjure images of being locked in a home office in your basement or attic with little natural light and no sense of time. Of work and home life blurring together as you find yourself working until midnight. Of not having any human interaction at all for months at a time. Sounds a lot like the \u0026ldquo;coder\u0026rdquo; stereotype, too.\nThis is more a symptom of tech and \u0026ldquo;startup\u0026rdquo; culture, I think, than of remote work culture. Cori Johnson at Model View Culture goes into this culture in Adderall Has a Tech Industry Problem, where the very first paragraph highlights everything that is wrong with our industry:\nIt’s no secret Silicon Valley has a problem with conspicuous consumption and drug abuse. Trace this behavior back up the pipeline to colleges where popping a pill gets a paper done on time. Instead of resting after working hard, recovery is substituted with playing hard, “blowing off steam,” and partying all night. This culture carries through to the internships, hackathons, crunch periods, and even the day-to-day work culture of tech startups and the gaming industry. As performance expectations rise, deadlines tighten, and 80-hour work weeks become the norm, stress and drug addiction rates in the Valley explode. And yet we mythologize this self-abuse as superhuman.\nEven disregarding the drug abuse part, things like pulling all-nighters, 80-hour weeks, and putting up with deadlines that border on physically impossible are seen as positive traits and are considered being a \u0026ldquo;rockstar.\u0026rdquo; These things are more damaging to our psyche than where we work, and yet, they\u0026rsquo;re held up as ideals. (Fun fact: Expensify expects their employees to work 50 hours a week as a norm and take pride in running their developers just shy of burn out.)\nWhen talking about remote working and remote-friendly environments, the fact that working beyond the typical 40 hours is itself isolating seems to be ignored. I think this is in part due to the farce that spending time in proximity to your coworkers counts as \u0026ldquo;socializing.\u0026rdquo; It doesn\u0026rsquo;t. Being around people and being with people are two different things. People need socialization outside and away from their coworkers. Seriously, no one needs to spend that much time together. Hell, I don\u0026rsquo;t even spend as many (waking) hours around my own husband as I have around coworkers in an office environment.\nI, personally, actually tend to be more social when I work for a remote-friendly company than when I work for an office-only company. Remote-friendly companies are more results-oriented and therefore, more flexible on hours and breaks (not always, and not completely, but usually, and mostly), which makes grabbing lunch with a friend much easier and less stressful.\nTo put it crudely, if you\u0026rsquo;re working remotely and haven\u0026rsquo;t had human contact in months, then you\u0026rsquo;re doing it wrong. If you feel isolated and in need of social contact, your work does not have to provide that. Find an interest group or take up a hobby that naturally puts you around people. Or, if just being around people is enough, work a day or two at your local coffee shop. Working remotely is only as isolating as you make it.\nRemote Friendly == Flexible Working Environment There\u0026rsquo;s a current trend going on in business in general, and it seems to be especially popular among tech companies and anyone with a large tech department \u0026ndash; open floor plans. There\u0026rsquo;s this pervasive idea that open floor plans foster collaboration, communication, idea flow, and other cultural equivalents of rainbows and unicorn farts.\nIt couldn\u0026rsquo;t be more wrong:\nIn 2011, the organizational psychologist Matthew Davis reviewed more than a hundred studies about office environments. He found that, though open offices often fostered a symbolic sense of organizational mission, making employees feel like part of a more laid-back, innovative enterprise, they were damaging to the workers’ attention spans, productivity, creative thinking, and satisfaction. Compared with standard offices, employees experienced more uncontrolled interactions, higher levels of stress, and lower levels of concentration and motivation. When David Craig surveyed some thirty-eight thousand workers, he found that interruptions by colleagues were detrimental to productivity, and that the more senior the employee, the worse she fared.\nWorkspace is not one size fits all. Some people do thrive in this type of environment. More power to them. Having an open section in the office for these people is a good way to accommdate them. So is being remote-friendly, where they can choose to work in a coffee shop, an open floorplan coworking space, or in your open floorplan office.\nNot everyone does well in this environment, however, and forcing those people into this environment for 8+ hours a day is doing a disservice to them and your company.\nSome people prefer working in a coffee shop (yes, there really are such people, I know a few).\nSome people prefer working at home on their couch.\nSome prefer an office to themselves.\nSome prefer an office shared with one or two other people.\nSome prefer all of these in turn, when the mood strikes.\nWith all of the tools at our disposal that make geography all but meaningless, all of these should be at a worker\u0026rsquo;s disposal. When your company is remote-friendly, all of these options are at a worker\u0026rsquo;s disposal.\nUncontrolled Interactions Are Most Detrimental To Developers They say a picture\u0026rsquo;s worth a thousand words. That saying is especially apt in this situation and beautifully illustrated in this image, courtesy Derek of thetomorrowlab.com.\nIn words, developers hold a lot of stuff in short-term, working memory \u0026ndash; most of which is difficult, if not impossible, to translate meaningfully and accurately to paper \u0026ndash; and the impromptu interruptions that an open floorplan encourage (both from people intentionally seeking your attention, and from that loud person two cubes down) blows all that short-term data away.\nEver work on a paper, presentation, or other project on the computer that you haven\u0026rsquo;t saved in an hour or two and the power goes out? That is basically what happens when you interrupt a developer. The only difference is that we can\u0026rsquo;t just hit the proverbial save button every few minutes. Said proverbial save button (notes) can only capture a fraction of what\u0026rsquo;s going on in the brain, and the more the person is interrupted, the more data they lose and the more time they have to spend rebuliding that mental model.\nAny workplace that provides mechanisms to control interruptions is generally a better fit for developers (and other high-level, creative or problem-solving people) than one that doesn\u0026rsquo;t. And no, putting headphones on doesn\u0026rsquo;t count as one such mechanism. Nice idea, but fails pretty hard in practice.\nA couple of Tweets sum it up nicely:\n@pamelafox Wait, you mean working in an environment with constant distraction and noise reduces productivity?\n\u0026mdash; Matthew McMillion (@mlmcmillion) December 30, 2014 @pamelafox I have seen my productivity decline a ton... Can\u0026#39;t focus, distracted, nervous all the time that I\u0026#39;m being watched\n\u0026mdash; Brenda Jin (@cyberneticlove) December 30, 2014 Remote Work != Lack Of Collaboration (Or Communication) As far as I can tell, this is one of the underlying ideas for all the times I see people cite \u0026ldquo;can\u0026rsquo;t collaborate\u0026rdquo; as a reason remote working is somehow inferior to working together in an office. What little information I can get from the people who hold this view amounts to \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t walk up to a person, tap them on the shoulder, and talk to them about something,\u0026rdquo; which I\u0026rsquo;ve already addressed. They also seem to think that no one talks to one another.\nHowever, the opposite is actually the case in a functioning remote environment. Chat applications, such as HipChat or Slack, provide the infrastructure for everyone to communicate with everyone else. Most remote friendly companies have a main channel that everyone is required to be in. In that channel, you check in and check out, whenever you go away for any length of time, and when you come back from being away. Shared calendar applications, such as Google Calendar or Exchange Calendar, are also required to keep track of times when people plan to be away or otherwise unavailable for any reason. Add to that tools like GoToMeeting, join.me, and Screenhero, among others, and there\u0026rsquo;s not much left that you can do in an office that you can\u0026rsquo;t in a remote environment.\nYes, if you really want, that includes virtually tapping someone on the shoulder. It\u0026rsquo;s called a direct, instant message with whatever messenger system your organization uses.\nYou can look at it another way, too \u0026ndash; if collaboration was indeed impossible or so cumbersome with distributed teams, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even be having this discussion on this blog. The code for this blog is hosted in a git repository, on Github, compiled by Octopress (which is an extension of Jekyll), which is written in Ruby. Github, itself, runs on a set of Linux boxes, developed on Vagrant boxes. Odds are, every router, switch, and DNS server between this Github server and your computer runs some variation of Linux, plus the routing/DNS software and any supporting software running on those servers.\nWhat do all these things have in common? They are built and maintained by teams that are partially or wholly distributed.\nThe Internet as a whole, as we know it, would not exist if collaboration on distributed teams were impossible.\nRemote Friendly == More Inclusive/Diverse The idea that non-verbal communication universally adds value to an interaction is actually incredibly ableist (and potentially a bit sexist).\nFirst, not everyone can read nonverbal communication, or the cognitive load of having to do so in addition to parsing the speaker\u0026rsquo;s words (and creating a response, and filtering out the other noise in the office, and\u0026hellip;and\u0026hellip;and\u0026hellip;) can be too much for them. Conditions like Autism, ADHD, and nonverbal learning disorder (NLD), in particular, have these issues. Autism and ADHD by themselves consistute a large portion of the tech community, as well as a large portion of the potential employee pool of people who are capable of performing the job in question, but can\u0026rsquo;t handle the social aspect.\nWikipedia has a good summary of the issues of NLD and the disorders that include it.\nWhat does this mean in a business context? It means that the positives cited for in-person communication \u0026ndash; eye contact, body language, tone, inflection \u0026ndash; actually detract from social interaction for people like this. Add to it the ambient noise of an open office environment, and it\u0026rsquo;s no wonder people with sensory processing issues and NLD don\u0026rsquo;t last long in conventional office environments.\nA remote-friendly work environment provides these people with the tools and the option for an ideal environment that allows them to meaningfully participate in the company \u0026ndash; both in larger meetings, and in more impromptu, one-on-one discussions.\nMore broadly, the Harvard Business Review published a study that included finding that not only were employees who chose working remotely more productive, but also that the option to work remotely attracted a larger variety of workers:\nWho else likes the work-from-home option?\nPeople who have established social lives—older workers, married workers, parents. We found that the younger workers whose social lives are more connected to the office tend to not want to work from home as much. Right now the employees who spend significant amounts of time working from home are on either end of the income spectrum: solitary, per-hour workers like call center reps, proofreaders, and developers, whose output can be easily tracked; or professionals and senior managers, who presumably are highly self-motivated.\nThe article also specifically cites that JetBlue\u0026rsquo;s remote friendly policy attracted \u0026ldquo;educated, highly-motivated mothers, who wanted flexibility in their jobs.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Silicon Valley companies are notorious for simultaneously shunning remote workers and complaining that they can\u0026rsquo;t find enough \u0026ldquo;top talent\u0026rdquo; to work for them. Likewise, they\u0026rsquo;re consistently criticised for the lack of diversity in their staff, especially in the tech/engineering positions. Why is that? Well, look at what it\u0026rsquo;s like to live and work in Silicon Valley \u0026ndash; high housing prices, hour-plus one-way commutes, gold-rush level competition, and high work churn between churning start ups and high-turnover tech giants (read - low job security). Hardly an appealling proposition for a midwestern geek mom like me, despite the fact that I\u0026rsquo;d love to have a name like Amazon or Google or Blizzard on my resume. The problem is, the glamor of those names, in and of themselves, pale in comparison to the real needs and risks of picking up my family and moving to the other side of the country. This results in companies that are dominated by young, white (and maybe Asian), single men (and not entirely accidentally, given the reports of active weeding out of people who are older, married, or want to live in the suburbs). In my experience, that\u0026rsquo;s ultimately a toxic culture, especially for me as a tech woman, as such places invariably give rise to \u0026ldquo;good ol\u0026rsquo; boys\u0026rsquo; clubs,\u0026rdquo; so even if I did thrive in the trendy open office floor plan environment, my days would likely be limited by virtue of being a woman and the mental/emotional wear and tear that comes with that, and then I\u0026rsquo;d have to find a new job in the gold-rush town that is Silicon Valley, or move elsewhere.\nOr, I could work remotely for a team, and be in a situation where it\u0026rsquo;s easier to forget that I\u0026rsquo;m female or what I look like (and, therefore, more likely to be judged on the quality of my work), where I have more control over my contact with people (and keep to a level that allows me to thrive, instead of destroying me), and where I can choose where to live (and not be forced to pick up my family and move somewhere where housing is 150% that of the national average and more than 200% that of where I currently live).\nI could probably write an entire stand-alone post on how remote friendly employers can be more diverse, since this section doesn\u0026rsquo;t even go into the diversity bonuses of hiring internationally and hiring people without ever seeing their faces (resulting in systems that can be as blind to race as is feasibly possible). We\u0026rsquo;ll save that for another time, though.\nRemote Working != Slacking (Or Underachieving) The best companies hire the best people and they generally want to go into the office daily.\nI kid you not, I actually had someone say that to me in a conversation about working remotely. When asked for details, the person only gave the usual \u0026ldquo;impromptu collaboration\u0026rdquo; reason, which I already addressed. However, this is a spectacular example of the mindset that equates \u0026ldquo;working remotely\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;slacking off\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;underachieving,\u0026rdquo; because it implies that those who choose to work remotely are somehow inferior to those who choose to work in an office.\nThis stems from an old fear of (middle) managers that if they can\u0026rsquo;t see the employee, they can\u0026rsquo;t control the employee. This leads to rampant presenteeism (employees, in the office, looking busy, but not actually doing anything), especially when the only metric for \u0026ldquo;productivity\u0026rdquo; is a butt in a chair.\nThe problem, though, isn\u0026rsquo;t remote working. It\u0026rsquo;s poor performance metrics, or lack of metrics entirely, that create slackers. The switch to a remote friendly environment just sheds light on these people, and either they shape up and start meeting those metrics, or you ship them out. It\u0026rsquo;s that simple.\nIn fact, real-world switches to a Results-Only Work Environment (which is remote-friendly by nature), improved productivity:\nSince the program\u0026rsquo;s implementation, average voluntary turnover has fallen drastically, CultureRx says. Meanwhile, Best Buy notes that productivity is up an average 35% in departments that have switched to ROWE. Employee engagement, which measures employee satisfaction and is often a barometer for retention, is way up too, according to the Gallup Organization, which audits corporate cultures.\nIn other words, people were more productive, when given control over when and where they worked, not less. Makes sense, when you consider the fact that not everyone succeeds in a particular work environment, or working a specific set of hours, and when you consider that our lives outside of work are generally run in a results-oriented fashion (either you\u0026rsquo;ve done your laundry or you haven\u0026rsquo;t, it\u0026rsquo;s that simple). Oh, and it happens repeatedly.\nBut What About Yahoo\u0026rsquo;s Remote Work Ban? But wait, what about Yahoo, and that \u0026ldquo;back to the office\u0026rdquo; call for remote workers? Well, it turns out to, so far, have pretty much no impact on Yahoo\u0026rsquo;s success\u0026hellip;or lack thereof (most of their stock increase between 2012 and 2014 is actually from Alibaba; many people estimate Yahoo\u0026rsquo;s value without it at negative $4 billion). Apparently, it requires not only hiring \u0026ldquo;the best talent,\u0026rdquo; but also requires giving said talent projects that make them feel like they\u0026rsquo;re actually innovating. Seems Ms. Mayer thought that if you put people together, that\u0026rsquo;d magically happen. She was probably sorely disappointed when most of the people from her first acqui-hire left (of the three the author could find, only one remained at Yahoo). Her attempts to impress the media industry with high-profile figures like Katie Couric also backfired (it might help if she realized that Steve Jobs hadn\u0026rsquo;t come up with the iPhone five years after his second round at Apple, but had come up with its predecessor, the MessagePad, or Newton, some 10 years before, that people were begging him to bring back, but he saw the cell phone era on the horizon and leveraged that to launch the iPhone into the popularity it now enjoys). The problem with Yahooa, that Ms. Mayer thinks will be solved by banning remote work (but won\u0026rsquo;t), is lack of overall morale, for one reason or another. Regardless of anything else in your work culture, if morale is low, so is productivity. Give employees meaningful work to do and a culture of true support and respect, and they\u0026rsquo;ll be productive in return.\nFinal Thoughts Despite myths to the contrary, remote-friendly companies are better off than their office-only counterparts, for a number of reasons. Working remotely may not be every individual\u0026rsquo;s cup of tea, but what\u0026rsquo;s important here is that the decision is left to the individual, not forced on everyone by upper management.\n","date":"May 15, 2015","description":"If you spend your days in a cave and haven't seen the light of day in months, you're doing it wrong.","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2015/05/15/in-defense-of-remote-friendly-work-environments/","series":null,"subtitle":null,"tags":["remote"],"title":"In Defense Of Remote Friendly Work Environments"},{"categories":null,"contents":"When in the throes of a depressive episode (or on the edge of an anxiety attack or any other such motivation killer), it can be hard to maintain motivation and productivity. This can be detrimental when other people rely on you, or when you have a job to hold down.\nOver the years, I\u0026rsquo;ve found a number of things that have helped keep me motivated through low times, and have decided to share them. Unlike other articles giving advice on \u0026ldquo;cheering up,\u0026rdquo; the items here may or may not actually lift your mood. That\u0026rsquo;s not the point of them, and anyone who\u0026rsquo;s dealt with depression will tell you that most of the time, things designed to \u0026ldquo;cheer you up\u0026rdquo; don\u0026rsquo;t really work. If it does lift your mood, then that\u0026rsquo;s a positive side effect, but as Winston Churchill put it, \u0026ldquo;when you\u0026rsquo;re going through hell, keep going.\u0026rdquo; These items are intended to do that \u0026ndash; help you keep going.\nEat\u0026hellip; Dysfunctional mental states, be it depression or mania, tend to screw with our eating patterns. It\u0026rsquo;s important during these times more than ever to make sure we keep good habits.\n\u0026hellip;The Right Amount Depression, especially, does one of two things to the appetite. It either kills it, or makes the person want to eat everything. For various other reasons, other mental illnesses often have similar effects. Both of these things have their own problems.\nEating too much food, especially the usual comfort foods of sugars and refined carbohydrates, is bad for the obvious reason that it will likely lead to weight gain, especially if it happens on a regular basis. Weight gain itself is often a self-esteem killer, and can result in a negative feedback loop, which most people already know.\nHowever, the obvious \u0026ldquo;too much food, not enough movement\u0026rdquo; aside, dysfunctional eating can have more short-term effects on your mood and motivation, especially if you swing the other way and don\u0026rsquo;t eat enough. By not eating enough, you deprive your body of the energy it needs to keep you going. This can start slowing you down as your body tries to conserve energy for vital uses. This state of lethargy can bring the mood down, as well as keep you from being motivated to do things. Again, a feedback loop ensues.\n\u0026hellip;At Regular Intervals Like making sure to eat enough, eating at regular intervals is also important, I\u0026rsquo;ve found. I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of the whole \u0026ldquo;eat six small meals\u0026rdquo; thing, but going half a day without food? Not necessarily a good idea. Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t feel terribly hungry, it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to eat at least a little bit of food, or eat once you get hungry, even if it\u0026rsquo;s starting to get close to the next meal time. I\u0026rsquo;ve personally found that both my motivation and my mood start going down the farther apart my meals are. So, try to keep your regular eating schedule.\n\u0026hellip;Wholesome, Whole Foods\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;ve found that my overall mood and motivation have largely stabilized (and at a higher base level) since switching to a whole foods-based diet. The better I eat, the less of a rollercoaster I have going on in my head.\nA lot of the diseases of civilization can be traced back to malnourishment, at least in part. Yeah, we have no shortage of food in our Western society, but look at the quality of the vast majority of it. Frankly, it sucks, and is largely devoid of nutrients. Get back to the basics \u0026ndash; meat, fruits, vegetables, etc. \u0026ndash; and odds are very good that you\u0026rsquo;ll start to see major improvements in all areas of your physical health, as your vitamin stores start actually filling back up. Deficiencies in things like folate, B-12, and magnesium can do a number on the brain and exacerbate depression, schizophrenia, and anxiety, among others. Eating whole foods provides your body with the most bioavailable forms of these nutrients.\n\u0026hellip;Including Healthy Fats I am a big fan of the low carb, high fat (LCHF) way of eating. The ketogenic diet (an \u0026ldquo;extreme\u0026rdquo; form of LCHF, where fat intake is upwards of 80-90% of total calories) was originally created for epilepsy, but has since been studied (or slated for study) for other neurological issues, including such things as depression, migraines, and more. I had switched to it for other reasons, but found positive effects in this area, as well.\nOne of the big things that a LCHF diet teaches you is that the conventional wisdom that has been burned into our brains is wrong (which is now starting to come back to mainstream media). Where conventional wisdom lauds polyunsaturated fats and vilifies saturated fats, LCHF shows how important naturally occurring saturated fats really are, and that polyunsaturated fats should be consumed only in moderation (and certainly not in the heavily-refined, Omega-6-heavy oils that conventional wisdom have on a pedestal). So, when I say \u0026ldquo;include healthy fats,\u0026rdquo; I also mean saturated fats, as well as monounsaturated fats, and, more sparingly, polyunsaturated fats. The only fat to really avoid is trans fat.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to switch to a LCHF diet to benefit from including good fats, but a good grass-fed butter and some virgin coconut oil are manna from the gods, let me tell you.\n(I\u0026rsquo;m not going to go into all the nitty-gritty details of the research regarding fat in this post, or even on this blog. I have a more health/fitness/diet related blog and will write about it in the future. When that happens, I\u0026rsquo;ll link to it for the research details. In the meantime, I welcome you to check out the recent meta-analysis of a few dozen studies regarding saturated fats and heart disease, and Dr. Peter Attia\u0026rsquo;s talk on the history of the anti-fat conventional wisdom.)\nDo An Intense Workout At Least Once A Week There\u0026rsquo;s just something about doing something so intense that you can\u0026rsquo;t help but focus on it and be in the moment, and, after you\u0026rsquo;re done, want little more than a hot shower and comfy bed, that helps relieve the latent, low-level anxiety and stress that seems to kill productivity. I\u0026rsquo;ve found that I\u0026rsquo;m a giant ball of nerves by Wednesday afternoon, but after my evening boxing class, it\u0026rsquo;s like night and day, and that carries me through the remainder of the week.\nThe important thing for this is to find something that forces you to focus on the moment, and wear you out. Things like martial arts or cardio boxing/kickboxing are good options, because you have to concentrate on your form, posture, moves, etc. Some martial arts also teach you various meditation/focusing techniques that can carry over to the rest of your life. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be these things, though. If you enjoy running, for example, then do sprints, or check out Parkour. What matters is forcing you into the moment and, to a lesser extent, getting the endorphine rush that comes with a strenuous workout.\nGet Outside And Go For A Walk This isn\u0026rsquo;t so much about fitness (the walk), but more about getting outside. Most people, and especially those with depression, are deficient in Vitamin D. The best way to get Vitamin D is from spending some time out in the sun, without sunscreen (Vitamin D synthesis is triggered by UV exposure, which is blocked by sunscreen). The walk is an added bonus to get the blood flowing, loosen stiff joints, and help build and maintain a base level of fitness, and just getting away from the computer helps your mind take a break and subconsciously mull over that problem you\u0026rsquo;ve been dealing with all morning. I personally enjoy tossing on a Podcast and walking for about an hour at an easy pace (shout out to Shawn McCool and his Laravel.io podcast, which are pretty consistently about an hour). If you want a virtual walking buddy, feel free to hit me up on RunKeeper (great app to track your routes and distances, by the way).\nTake A Spa Day Once In A While Seriously, it seems really girly to have a spa day once in a while, but it\u0026rsquo;s astounding how good it can be at relaxing you (and there are places that will give men massages and facials, too). Like the intense workout, it helps prompt you to be in the moment, and it feels extraordinarily good to get a nice massage (I\u0026rsquo;m a fan of deep tissue massages, myself) and release that pent up tension in your shoulders and back.\nIf you really don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of a spa day (or can\u0026rsquo;t afford it), do something similarly relaxing, even if it\u0026rsquo;s just a hot bath or meditation. Being able to physically relax your body for a time can help relieve low-level psychological stress, which can, in turn, increase your motivation to get things done. Some type of \u0026ldquo;me\u0026rdquo; day also gives you something to look forward to, if you need something to get you through the day.\nCreate A Todo List It feels good to me to check off an item on a list. At the very least, though, I\u0026rsquo;ve found it helps get that list out of my head and off-load it from my memory, so that I can use those cognitive resources for actually getting that shit done. This has proven to be a huge benefit to my productivity \u0026ndash; particularly for my side projects \u0026ndash; as I find myself glancing at the list and going \u0026ldquo;I want to work on that tonight.\u0026rdquo; Even if I don\u0026rsquo;t finish the task in question, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about keeping it on my mental list, because it\u0026rsquo;s on a physical/digital one. It actually allows me to juggle the few dozen ideas and side projects I have bouncing around my head, without feeling overwhelmed by them (which is good, because they\u0026rsquo;re all freakin\u0026rsquo; time-consuming as hell, and I can\u0026rsquo;t generally just knock two or three out in an evening).\nI\u0026rsquo;ve become a fan of Any.do, because I can set recurrances (like doing Yoga each day), or set some tasks to \u0026ldquo;Someday,\u0026rdquo; which keeps them separate from the stuff to do \u0026ldquo;Today.\u0026rdquo; I also love the integration it has with my Android phone, including a calendar app (it\u0026rsquo;s got a slick interface).\nI also enjoy Workflowy, and used it for a short time as a Todo list, as well. It\u0026rsquo;s become more of a shopping list for me when I do use it, but I know a few people who prefer it over other things for any kind of list making. There are many others to choose from, too, so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter what tool you use, as long as it works for you.\nKeep A Clean Working Area Clutter is often a trigger for stress. It can add cognitive overhead and lower your stress tolerance or threshold for getting overwhelmed. So, while it may not seem like it\u0026rsquo;s adding stress or exacerbating depression symptoms, it might still be affecting you. Keep your work area (and, ideally, any area you spend a fair amount of time in) clutter free. In practice, this works best if you keep it clean, instead of trying to clean it while in a low state (though if it\u0026rsquo;s mild enough, or if the clutter is light enough, cleaning it up might serve as a motivation booster).\nFinal Thoughts Hopefully, one or more of these suggestions will help. I\u0026rsquo;ve found, too, that a lot of these work best when you make a habit out of them. A single walk is pretty good, by itself, but making it a daily (or nearly so) habit helps keep your body increase its energy levels over time, giving you a higher base level of energy, which makes getting things done just a little bit easier. So, give one or two (or three) a shot for a couple of weeks and see how they work for you.\n","date":"Oct 30, 2014","description":"","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2014/10/30/motivation/","series":null,"subtitle":"When You're Going Through Hell","tags":["community contribution","mental health","HackTheStigma"],"title":"Ways To Keep Going"},{"categories":["tech","business"],"contents":"Dear Third Party Recruiters,\nDue to the high volume of contact requests I’ve received, I have decided to write this open letter in order to improve the quality of my network.\nThe Greater Columbus Area is home to a very large number of third party recruiting companies. This means you have a lot of competition. Competition should mean improved quality. Unfortunately, what I generally see is rather disappointing.\nWe tech folks are generally a merit-based people. We’ll respect you if we have reason to do so. You can earn that respect by demonstrating that you respect us and what we do (and no, saying that you do doesn’t cut it; show, don’t tell). Here are some ways to do that.\nHave some fundamental understanding of the technology Or, don\u0026rsquo;t play buzzword Bingo.\nI don’t expect you to have been a developer, but I do expect basic, high-level knowledge, such as the fact that Java and JavaScript are two very different things. How can you expect to get proper, let alone quality, matches for the companies you’re recruiting for if you can’t even get the technology right?\nPay attention to the last time I used a technology, and the ones I use now Or, do some some homework.\nI know there’s a certain amount of crossover when it comes to technologies, but there’s also a sort of expiration date, especially at the Senior Developer level. I have not touched Java since 2007. Odds are, I am not a good fit for that great Android developer position you’re looking to fill, nor will I be interested in it, nor am I likely to have anyone in my circles that use it. For the record, my network primarily covers the open source languages (PHP, Ruby, Python) and, to a lesser extent, the .Net languages. However, I won’t be forwarding your leads to them if you haven’t taken the time to build some rapport with me.\nPay attention to all of the technologies I use My time at a design agency has resulted in a number of “front end!” development position leads, since a large portion of my job was HTML and CSS. Now, while a front end development position may not get immediately trashed, you will probably find a far better match with me for a full stack position.\nI’ll be among the first to admit \u0026ndash; software is a huge industry (really, there isn’t a word in the English language that adequately describes just how mind-boggling huge an industry it is). Front end web development is, on its own, enormous. If a company is looking for a dedicated front-end person, odds are, I don’t know half of what they’re looking for, at least not to the level that would best serve them. Now, while I’d love to learn it and would have no qualms doing so (hell, it’s how I’ve learned most of the technologies I use at this moment), odds are very good that I’m not as great a match for the company as you might think. There’s probably someone out there better suited to that particular position.\nDon’t get me wrong \u0026ndash; if the company doesn’t mind a little more time to pick up the new technology and the ins and outs of the new (to me) company, then by all means. However, most companies, especially those going through the heavy, active recruiting that you get paid to do, generally prefer someone who can “hit the ground running.” Angular/Backbone/Ember/Knockout may be a JavaScript framework, but it’s enough of its own beast that just knowing JavaScript probably isn’t enough for a “hit the ground running” position.\nInstead, look at what I do use, and look at all of it, especially in recent gigs. Odds are very good that if you have a position that needs a little bit of everything, then I am a good fit for it. Framework matches? Even better!\nWrite better introductions I literally received an email from a third party recruiter that started like this:\nI was just cruising around the web, and I stumbled upon what you've been up to on the software engineering front. Seriously? Now, I don’t expect some kind of formal thesis with the formal greetings we all learned in school, but come on. Do you really expect me to believe that you, a person whose entire job is to seek out people like me, was “cruising around the web” and happened to stumble on my website/Twitter/LinkedIn profile? Really, it sounds like a bad pickup line.\nGranted, I’m sure there is a certain amount of meandering going on, following leads and connections, friends-of-friends and blog posts by related authors. It’s not like I’ve made myself scarce in the online world. If you really just happened upon my information, then cool, I’ve done my job at least to some extent.\nBut please don’t fluff it up like the above quote. Something like “I found your LinkedIn profile” or “saw one of your blog posts mentioned in a Tweet on my feed,” or whatever other more straightforward and non-sickening way of telling me where you found my information is much less likely to get your email immediately deleted. You also get some brownie points for being more specific with how you’ve found me.\nFor that matter, introduce yourself If you send me a LinkedIn invite, and all it reads is the \u0026ldquo;Join my LinkedIn network\u0026rdquo; canned pre-fill text, then your invite will get trashed. I don\u0026rsquo;t collect contacts, especially third party recruiters.\nBe more straightforward in general I hate social games. I value straightforwardness and despise things like this:\nI came across your profile on LinkedIn while researching Developer professionals. Your background/experience caught my eye so I’m sending you a quick note to see if you'd be able to point me in the right direction. Our client is looking for a Web Developer in the Columbus, OH area! Do you know of anyone who may be interested?\nEspecially when it’s followed by this, when I ask for more information:\nI wanted to see if you were still interested in this opportunity! We sat down with the client this week and were able to find out a ton more details of exactly what they are looking for, I would love to talk some details with you! Now, I understand that, as a third party, you can’t (or are hesitant to) disclose things like the company name (though doing so would earn you some brownie points; otherwise, it conveys the message that you don’t trust me, and that’s not a good start), but if you don’t want your email to end up in the trash bin, then give me at least some information about the job itself \u0026ndash; things like what technologies, number of years experience. You know, the usual.\nThis also highlights another issue.\nDon’t insist on only talking to me via phone First off, if you’re not willing to put something in writing, then that itself raises a red flag and makes me more likely to dismiss you.\nSecond, phone calls \u0026ndash; particularly unexpected/unsolicited ones \u0026ndash; are intrinsically intrusive. Additionally, developers typically run on what can be described as the maker’s schedule, and I’m not exception. By calling me, you’ve diverted my attention from my work, broken my concentration. The phone call itself does this, even if I don’t answer. At the very least, your call has just cost me roughly 10-15 minutes in productivity. Since time is money, you then owe me a fancy coffee at a hipster coffee shop, just for the interruption. If I actually answer and talk to you, you might as well buy me lunch.\nIn fact, if you’re really interested in me and talking to me, then do that \u0026ndash; buy me lunch. We can organize a lunch meeting via email (when I can respond at a time that suits me), and chat about things then. And keep in mind, it’s not about the free food aspect. It’s about respecting and valuing my time.\nCommunicate with your other branches and don’t spam and harass me A one point earlier this year, I received 5 emails and 3 phone calls from different people at different branches of the same recruiting company in the span of 2 weeks. Two weeks! Even worse? Nearly half of those came after I asked them to remove me from their system (for the third time, no less).\nThat will get you reported to the Better Business Bureau, and you will be made known to my network as someone to not work with. Developers talk. Our industry may be huge, but our community is quite small. I can’t tell you the number of people I’ve found that I’ve crossed paths with in one way or another or found that my friends have shared connections beyond casual “friend” or “connection” gathering on social media networks. Earning yourself a place on my blacklist will very likely earn yourself a place on the blacklist of a few dozen other developers (conversely \u0026ndash; earning a place of respect with me will make it more likely to get referrals from me).\nI understand that there aren’t really any convenient times during which you can call, but that makes it even more important to not spam or harass me.\nDon’t send me leads in other cities Unless I’ve indicated a willingness to relocate (even better, a willingness to relocate to that city), or the company genuinely supports remote working (not just kind of puts up with it), I’m very, very likely not interested in it. Additionally, even if I am interested or would consider it, absence of a relocation package will pretty much guarantee I’ll ignore it. Selling a house and moving a family is a pain in the ass, so there’s a lot of inertia there.\nWhat I want in a job Now that you’ve read this far, let’s look at the things that I want in a job. I’m in a good position right now and am not specifically looking to change. Therefore, while I always keep my ear to the ground, I can afford to be ultra-picky. Odds are very, very good, then, that I will ignore any lead that doesn’t match up with the following things.\nThese are not the demands of an entitled young worker. These are things that I’ve found work best for me and allow me to be a better employee to an employer. These are also things that I’ve found that say a lot about the quality of the environment. In other words, the more of these qualities that a company fulfills, the more likely I’ll be a good match for the company (not just the position itself).\nOnly agencies that truly value their developers This really applies to all companies, but from the experiences I’ve had at the ones I worked at suggest that agencies are some of the worst offenders. When the people in an environment that’s proven toxic for me repeatedly tell me that that company is better than the other (big player) agencies that they’ve worked at, that sends a pretty clear message that I want nothing to do with the entire lot.\nI’ve worked in agency environments, and they were all a big fail to me. The worst fail was with a company that touted great culture, but it was lip service and superficial things \u0026ndash; the pool table, ping pong table, and video games that I’d seen used a collective less than half a dozen times in the year and a half I was there; the happy hours and parties that were as much a disturbance to us as good things. The things that really matter to good culture \u0026ndash; not overloading us with work, providing us with quiet environments, and the ability of project and account managers to reign in a client and say “no” once in a while (especially when the client expects it without paying extra or adjusting the deadline) \u0026ndash; are what I’m interested in. Without these things, I crash and burn, and such an environment is a toxic one for me.\nBrownie points: encourage self-direction of projects and full project ownership I’m a big fan of Zack Holman’s articles on some of GitHub’s ideals. In this case, it’s his “Creativity Means Self-Direction” section of this one. This isn’t a deal-breaking ideal, but the company that does this would be worth its weight in gold, particularly on top of fulfilling the other ideals. I would love to be able to work on the project(s) that I choose to work on, and be able to take full ownership and have a certain amount of control/authority over that project, and tinker it to improve it as I see fit.\nRemote work friendly I have found that a company’s view on people working remotely has been a fairly accurate barometer for other environmental mindsets.\nMy ideal is the option to work full time remotely. My line of work does not require physical presence in a specific location. Many of the best teams in my industry are comprised of people who have never met in person. It most certainly can be done successfully, given the right infrastructure.\nI may consider a position that allows it on a regular part time basis. This does not mean “you can work from home if you’re snowed in…” but rather, I have the option to, say, work from home on Wednesdays, because those are my most productive days, and I can encourage that productivity by working in an environment that I’ve set up to be ideal for me and don’t have to worry about people walking up to me and interrupting me while I’m in the zone.\nResults-only work environment If you don’t know what this is, here’s some required reading for you, and when you’re done with that pick up Why Work Sucks And How To Fix It and read it . I’ll wait.\nDone with your homework? Good, because this one’s come to be a deal-breaker for me.\nIn the US, developers are nearly always exempt salary (thank you “Fair” Labor Standards Act…), and most employers are too hung up on number of hours worked. This is a very bad combination, because it is very easily abused to get what amounts to free labor. Developers are creative people, with peaks and troughs of productivity. It does a disservice to both us and our employers if we’re not able to honor those troughs by doing something else in our lives that can break us out of these non-productive phases, especially during slow times in the company. Requiring me to work a particular number of hours a day or week, even when there’s no or not much work to do, is not “hour flexibility,” nor is it “work life balance” (especially if I’m required to use accumulated paid time off of any sort if I don’t work those hours). If I’m salaried, you’re paying me for the value I bring to the company, not for my time. If you’re going to hold me to a time clock, pay me proper overtime pay. I’m a professional level employee with an advanced set of skills, not a slave.\nIn short, I am much more willing to work overtime when needed if I know that I don’t have to work a “regular” number of hours during the next slow period.\nAdditionally, a ROWE discourages office politics. I despise office politics and don’t do well with them (for reasons I’ve explained elsewhere on my blog). So, a ROWE is more likely to be a workplace that’s friendlier to my personality, making it that much more likely that my relationship with the company will be a long and happy one.\nBrownie points: use modern tools and technologies This isn’t a deal-breaking thing, but it is an ideal. Simply put, I’m able to do more and be more productive when I’m able to work with modern tools, instead of trying to fight with a legacy system that doesn’t follow any standards (unless I’m modernizing said legacy system).\nPhew! You made it! Read all the way through that and still have something for me? Awesome! Send it my way, being mindful of the things we talked about here.\n","date":"Oct 15, 2014","description":"How not to fail at getting on my short list.","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2014/10/15/dear-recruiters/","series":null,"subtitle":null,"tags":["tips","culture"],"title":"An Open Letter To Recruiters"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":"I’ve been torn over how open I should be with this, particularly in my professional life. My first instinct has been for it to be on a very need to know basis.\nThen I met Greg Baugues.\nGreg is a developer evangelist (devangelist) for Twilio, who speaks at conferences about his ADHD and Type II Bipolar, and he gets well-deserved standing ovations pretty much wherever he speaks. I still fight tearing up just thinking about the talk I attended at Laracon, back in mid-May, where he even took his Bipolar medication on stage.\nIf you ever have the opportunity, attend this man’s talk. Even if you’ve seen the videos of it.\nHe’s the driving force behind this entry. Until now, I’ve kept my professional image away from my more personal parts. I’ve compartmentalized my identity, basically. Tech and business here, mental and physical health over there, homesteading over there (insert gestures to different directions here). But the truth is, my having Autism and Depression are part of what shapes me as a person and affects my professional life, whether I want them to or not. And just like I have started looking up to Greg as a role model for someone who has seen success with his ADHD and Bipolar out in the open, the others out there need more people to look up to, as well. We all need people to understand us and our differences, so that they can see us as strengths to be embraced, instead of liabilities to be feared. And, as Robin Williams’ death has shown so vividly, we need to be able to talk about these things openly and not be ashamed of them.\nI Am Autistic My official diagnosis is actually Asperger’s Syndrome, but as of the release of the DSM-V in May 2013, that got rolled into the “official” Autism name. It never really wasn’t part of the Autism Spectrum, but now it just goes by the name High Functioning Autism. Either way, it means that I can blend in with others most of the time, but still relate better to the little boy who freaks out at the crying baby, runs to a corner, and starts rocking back and forth.\nIn his talk, Greg brought up the “Hunter-Farmer hypothesis,” which is commonly used to explain the origin of ADHD. It’s an interesting theory that basically states that such differences in neurological functioning were not only beneficial, but arguably essential when we were hunter-gatherers, but that since we settled down and started farming, those differences started becoming maladaptive. Those with ADHD now would have been the hunters then, with laser focus under pressure, and bursts of high activity. They may have even been able to “fly under the radar” for generations as soldiers, which experience the same kind of peak and trough routine (or as Greg put it, “War has been described as long periods of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror.”), and it’s only very recently, when we’ve all been forced to sit still for hours on end from the time we’re five years old, that it’s become a problem, and since it started becoming a problem, it has exploded in our faces.\n{% pullquote left %} {\u0026quot; If ADHD people are hunters and soldiers, then Autistics are the foragers and artisans. \u0026ldquo;} {% endpullquote %}\nThere is a hypthesis that parallels ADHD-as-hunter, known as the Solitary Forager Hypthesis. In it, Jared Reser explores the idea that some of the common symptoms of Autism \u0026ndash; repetition, rote memorization, obsession over things modern society deems trivial \u0026ndash; may have been highly beneficial traits in hunter-gatherer times. Additionally, the Autistic’s ability to work alone and not be wholly dependent on social groups may have been advantageous, especially in tribes that lived in places where foraging took the individuals far and away from each other for great lengths of time. Like those with ADHD were probably able to find their niches until very recently, I think so did Autistics, in the form of artisans, scholars, and monks \u0026ndash; who spent their entire lives replicating things, doing the same thing over and over, and meticulously honing their craft in a near-obsessive way, with some going so far as to not talk to others and taking a vow of silence.\nReser concludes with this, which I think is a phenomenal philosophy for not just Autism, but ADHD and several other neuro-atypical states:\n{% pullquote %} Showing that autism had ecological viability and that it exists today because of its success in the past suggests that it should not be considered a disease, but instead a condition. {\u0026rdquo; It should not be thought of as something to be ashamed of \u0026ldquo;} , but as something that represents individuality, self-determination and autonomy. {% endpullquote %}\nI Also Have Depression The outpouring of awareness support for mental illness in the wake of Robin Williams\u0026rsquo; death has sparked a rise, especially in the developer community, of efforts to end the stigma around mental illness, so that those with them don’t feel ashamed to seek help. I am no exception for either giving or needing to receive that support, and I hope this marks a more permanent rise in such movements than what past losses have seen.\nI was diagnosed with Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (DD-NOS) after a late-term miscarriage that, for all intents and purposes, shattered every fiber of my being. That event not only turned me into a vastly different (and unfortunately, more fragile) person, but it exacerbated what was already there.\nThe truth of the matter is that I’ve suffered from Depression to one degree or another for about as long as I can remember. Whether it was slowly ingrained into me by a life surrounded by abusive people, both peers and those in positions of authority, or if it was there first and just painted a target on my back for those people, I don’t know. Frankly, it doesn’t matter anymore.\nEven when I was younger, the thought of suicide had crossed my mind on more than one occasion, and in recent years, such thoughts have increased in frequency, though I’ve always been too selfless to actually go through with it, because I don’t want to upset my family, and don’t want to put the stress of things like a funeral and being a single father on my husband. It’s not that I think suicide is a “selfish” act \u0026ndash; I don’t believe it is \u0026ndash; but rather that I’m not a very selfish or self-serving person by nature. I’m driven to please others or feel “needed” or “useful.” Something like suicide is the polar opposite to that, and, therefore, takes a considerable amount of effort just to do it. It probably also helps that I end up over-thinking and, in a sense, “over-engineering” my way out of actually going through with it.\nI mention the miscarriage, because that’s really also something else that needs to be talked about more. Did you know that the miscarriage rate is upwards of 50% of all pregnancies when chemical pregnancies and other very early miscarriages are taken into account? I didn’t know that, either, until 2006. Even excluding those, the miscarriage rate for Western society is still about 20%. In other words, for every 5 women you know, one of them will have miscarried a known pregnancy. Late term miscarriages \u0026ndash; any that happen betmaween 12 and 24 weeks \u0026ndash; have a rate of 1 in 100, and stillbirths \u0026ndash; after 24 weeks \u0026ndash; have a rate of 1 in 160. This means that odds are very good that you’ve met at least one woman who has lost a pregnancy. And yet, how many of us know the people that have suffered through this? This is why we need to talk more about it, especially since late term miscarriages and stillbirths are particularly devastating.\nAt that point, you’ve bonded with your unborn child. You’ve probably already had a baby shower. The nursery’s almost done, you’re part way through those birthing classes. You’ve seen the “big” ultrasound. And then, one day, everything grinds to a screeching, horrific, agonizing halt.\nBut it doesn’t end there, and this is one of those things that really no one talks about. For most sudden traumatic events, the actual event is over relatively quickly, and once it’s done, you can focus on healing, possibly with the help of painkillers. It doesn’t work that way for a woman that experiences a late-term loss, because the body still goes through the postnatal motions as though nothing bad has happened. This includes lactating. The worst pain in the world \u0026ndash; producing milk for an infant that isn’t there \u0026ndash; there are no painkillers for that two weeks of hell.\nYes, this was very much my breaking point, and the best image I have for it is quite literally a glass item dropping and shattering into a few million pieces. It’s a shame Eragon the movie didn’t hold true to the books, or the shattering of the Star Sapphire at the Battle of Farthen Dur would have been a perfect image for those who haven’t gone through such a loss (as it stands, it’s still a perfect metaphor). Unfortunately, unlike the dwarves in Eragon, we don’t have dragon magic to restore us to our former glory, even if we and our fleet of people dedicated to piecing us back together could manage to do so.\nLike a good friend of mine, Kayla, related, there are a number of times where I’ve sat alone and cried, or cried myself to sleep. Sometimes, there may be a trigger \u0026ndash; not a reason, per se, but rather, something that starts the chain reaction. Maybe it’s a bad day at work, a fight with my husband, or my mind replaying real or imagined horrors. Other times, there’s no known reason at all, just the nothingness itself weighing down on me.\nI’m Not Alone Wired Magazine nailed it way back in 2004: the stereotypical “geek” is more likely to be on the Autism Spectrum (and therefore have kids who are also on the Spectrum). And it’s true, computers and electronics, and the professional fields that revolve around them, attract people with varying levels of Autism. I suspect that it largely has to do with the fact that technology itself (and math in general) is based on clear-cut rules and standards, and those rules and standards usually have a reason behind them. There may be a hundred ways to solve a problem, but all of those ways still require laying out a set of rules to achieve an end. Technology makes sense in a world that is otherwise run by arbitrary nonsense to us. So, if you work in, or in any way interact with people who work in, technology, odds are, you’ve met someone with Autism, even if you didn’t realize it.\nEven if you aren’t involved at all with anything technology-related, with the Autism diagnostic rate somewhere between 1 in 50 and 1 in 68 (depending on who you ask), odds are, you’ve met someone with Autism. And since not everyone with Autism gravitates toward technology, it may even be that new artist you saw at your local gallery, or the odd neighbor kid.\n{% pullquote left %} To compound matters, there’s also the fact, as Greg mentions in his talk on Devs and Depression, that tech attracts the people most prone to mental illness in general. As such, while the numbers are a lot more fuzzy, there’s little doubt that our industry has a high rate of people with Depression, Bipolar, and other mental illnesses, if for no other reason than that {\u0026rdquo; tech culture attracts the oddities that are a result of mental illness \u0026ldquo;} (as Greg said in his talk, “we accept introverted behavior, odd sleeping patterns, inconsistent bursts of productivity, and a sense of grandiosity… we are your people”). {% endpullquote %}\nWhat Does It All Mean? For me, it means I’ve got a witty, no-holds-barred, sarcastic, confident woman trapped inside a fearful, anxiety-filled body and brain. I can’t count the number of times I’ve imagined a conversation \u0026ndash; any conversation \u0026ndash; where I’d be able to make some kind of witty response, or even just stand up for myself without shutting down, and actually succeed at doing so.\nI’ve had a running theory that Autism is largely and input/output disorder \u0026ndash; the common threads in nearly all Autistics is difficulty processing input (sensory overload, slow auditory processing, etc), and difficulty turning it into output (difficulty with spoken conversation, not showing emotion, etc). As such, there are a number of myths that have formed, as researchers and doctors try to make sense of Autism and help people with it. I’ll go into detail another time, as there’s a lot to be said on the matter, but I’ll touch on some of the things in a moment.\nMy personal history with both Autism and Depression have made me a very self-aware kind of person. This is very much a double-edge sword, because I can see where failure points are, but don’t always have the knowledge or means of correcting said failure points. In other words, I can see that something is failing (usually communication), but I can’t figure out why or what to do about it or even to mitigate the resulting issues. This occasionally leads to a negative feedback loop, where the Depression starts to take over in the form of despair for being able to get things right.\nOkay, But What Does It Mean? Waxing philosophical about the ups and downs of both matters is a great pass time, but what does it mean for those around me, in day-to-day interactions?\nWell, first, let me address some misconceptions of primarily Autism, and to a lesser extent, Depression:\nIt does not mean that I am violent, prone to violence, or will become a serial killer (or any other form of murderer).\nIt does not mean that I am mentally disabled.\nIt does not mean that I lack empathy or have no feelings, though I may feel and express them differently from other people.\nIt does not mean that my Autism in need of a “cure,” or that I otherwise need “fixed.” My Depression may be a mental illness, but my Autism is not, and there is a difference.\nIt does not mean that I’m constantly under suicide watch or that I’d do something drastic just because someone said something I didn’t like.\nIf I happen to be on antidepressants at the time, it does not mean that I have to be happy all the time, or that the medication is not working if I show even the slightest hint of a negative emotion.\nIt does mean that I communicate better through asynchronous means (writing, as opposed to speaking), for a multitude of reasons.\nIt does mean that sometimes I will get overstressed and need to remove myself from the situation, and that when that happens, I need enough respect and compassion from others to give me some space and time.\nIt does mean that I do better knowing things ahead of time, such as changes in schedules or meeting agendas (especially when said meeting is prone to be emotionally charged or critical of me/my work).\nIt does mean that, particularly when it comes to social infractions, I genuinely may not know what has upset someone, and telling me “you’re smart, you can figure it out,” does not help me.\nIt does mean that I will always prioritize the things that help me above all else. This includes proper diet and exercise, and the means and time to achieve those. This also means that I am very protective of my work-life balance, and will strive to ensure that I’m not working more than I can handle. My ability to stop working at a reasonable hour so that I can participate in that day’s workout and cook my dinner as opposed to ordering pizza and soda is what allows me to be productive each day and keep working on the things that make my employer money. No job is worth my well-being, especially since sacrificing the latter will inevitably sacrifice the former.\nWhat Can We Do? Recognize That Not Everyone Who Is Sick Looks So {% pullquote %} Mental illness, like many physical illnesses, manifest in ways that most of society deems, from the outside looking in, as character flaws. According to society, or anyone that doesn’t experience it themselves, we don’t do something not because we’re sick and are physically incapable of doing that thing, but because we’re “lazy” or “unmotivated.” {\u0026rdquo; It’s the phrase just about everyone with an invisible illness has heard from anyone who knows but doesn’t understand their situation \u0026ndash; “but you don’t look sick.” \u0026ldquo;} {% endpullquote %}\nThis image illustrates the problem quite well, as does this story, for those more inclined for words.\nIf you do not suffer from an invisible illness, recognize that just because you can’t see the symptoms, it doesn’t mean they’re not there. They are very much there, very much real, and those of us with them spend every waking moment doing what we can to keep it from consuming us and our lives. For some of us, the very act of getting out of bed is little short of a miracle. What you see is generally an act or part of a plan to get through the day and meet such needs as earning money.\nWe’re not being lazy or making excuses when we say we can’t do something. Do you say that a paraplegic is just being lazy by not walking, or a blind person just isn’t trying hard enough at seeing? No? The same applies to mental illness. A person suffering from Depression can’t just “try harder” at being happy. It doesn’t work that way.\nProvide Reasonable Work Hours and Conditions If you’re an employer, especially in the tech industry, remember that not everyone is a healthy, single, 20-something who has no life outside of working for you, and that this is not a bad thing. Different people bring different experiences and knowledge to the table, providing valuable input.\nInstead of viewing these things as liabilities, view them as assets to be cultivated and nurtured. Really, all people should be treated this way, as no one should have to work ungodly numbers of hours every day. That’s a sure path to destruction of even the healthiest of individuals, though it may take longer.\nFor those with mental illnesses, it’s better to be able to work shorter hours, which keeps us from long-term destruction, than to run us ragged and destroy us in a few months or, at best, a couple of years. It’s been shown that everyone \u0026ndash; with or without any kind of chronic illness \u0026ndash; does better on shorter hours and that long hours are at best useless and at worst counterproductive. There’s a reason labor laws are supposed to limit workers to 40 hours a week (“exempt” status notwithstanding), and those reasons don’t just apply to the blue collar workers for whom such laws are actually enforced.\nTalk For those of us with mental illnesses, we can start by talking about it. There are a couple of hashtags floating around Twitter. The main one is #EndTheStigma, which includes not just mental health, but other stigmatized things as well. There’s also a new one rising up, called #HackTheStigma, that was originally created due to not wanting to be associated with the “End The Stigma” campaigns used by some companies.\nEven if you’re not ready to talk openly, you can reach out to me or any of the others in the community that have opened their inboxes and/or phones.\nWe’re here. You’re not alone.\n","date":"Aug 19, 2014","description":"","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2014/08/19/youre-not-alone/","series":null,"subtitle":null,"tags":["community contribution","HackTheStigma"],"title":"You're Not Alone"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Handcrafted CSS: More Bulletproof Web Design, Video Edition\nWhile at one of my previous clients, a coworker ordered this book as a resource at the office. I was the first to read it and simply couldn't put it down. Handcrafted CSS: More Bulletproof Web Design highlights modern CSS techniques that help build robust, attractive, designs.\nUnlike most technical books, which often provide too much tech and not enough explanation, or too much theory and not enough tech, this book provides a fantastic balance, and even uses a running case study that it builds and enhances as the reader progresses through the book. Not only are readers able to understand the concepts the book presents, but they also learn ways to put the new concepts into practice.\nOne of the important points the book emphasizes is progressive enrichment, or designing for the future. CSS3 is complete enough that some of its features can already be used in modern browsers, which already provides us with a way to create beautiful designs that don't require much, if any (let alone extensive) use of images or JavaScript -- nearly everything can be done entirely in CSS. The principles of progressive enrichment put forth in the book allow developers to write forward-thinking code, creating designs that will essentially self-improve as browsers implement more CSS capabilities.\nAnother unique aspect to the book is that not only can it be easily read cover-to-cover without being too dry and code-saturated, but it also serves very well as a desktop reference. The chapters and sections are organized in an easy-to-access manner and cover, in fair depth, specific features of CSS (as opposed to more broad subjects encompassing several features).\nThis book is a must-have for intermediate to advanced CSS coders, be they designers or developers, and even beginning coders that are serious in learning how to write robust, forward-thinking, and semantic code.\n","date":"Jun 21, 2010","description":"","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2010/06/21/review-handcrafted-css/","series":null,"subtitle":null,"tags":["review","css"],"title":"Review: Handcrafted CSS"},{"categories":["business"],"contents":" Why Work Sucks and How to Fix It: No Schedules, No Meetings, No Joke--the Simple Change That Can Make Your Job Terrific\nYou anxiously look at your watch as the traffic creeps forward - 8:55am. There's no way you'll get to the office by 9, you still have 10 miles to go. When you finally do arrive at 9:15, you try to sneak to your desk unnoticed, but your boss is already there. \"So nice of you to join us this morning,\" he greets you, a \"do it again and you're fired\" look on his face. You sit down at your desk, still a little too agitated to start work quite yet, so you read your favorite news site for ten minutes. Part of you resigns to this life, believing it's the way things are, and nothing will change, but another part of you feels that there must be a better way.\nThat second part is right. There is a better way.\nFormer Best Buy employees Cali Ressler and Jody Thompson (now owners of CultureRx) share their experience of transforming Best Buy's corporate culture from the traditional clock-watching to a Results-Only Work Environment, or ROWE, and how ROWE can work for other companies. The idea seems counterintuitive, at first, especially to those entrenched in traditional corporate culture and politics, but as Cali and Jody start breaking down the obstacles and overcoming objections, the idea starts to make sense. Give people control over their time, allow them to work when and where they're most productive, and grade them on their results, and instead of slacking and decreased productivity, they'll reward the company with increased performance, increased satisfaction, and lower voluntary turnover.\nWhy is it that the results seem counter to what managers fear? Because it's what everyone already does...just not at work. When we do our household work, we don't deal with politics, we don't \"look like\" we're doing something, we are doing things. We \"grade\" ourselves on whether the work gets done or not. The laundry either gets washed or put away, or it doesn't. The dishes make it into the dishwasher or they don't. We do all this stuff on the weekends or after work and don't really think about it, nor do we really get burnt out from doing the usual \"home-life\" stuff we need to do on a regular basis, and we can do this because we have control over our time, so we can use it as we see fit. This doesn't happen at work, because at work, we're not in control of our time. If we get done with our work without filling up our required 40 hours, then we either have to find more work to do, or we have to look busy. Going home and enjoying the rest of the day or week is out of the question.\nWhy Work Sucks goes into detail about this problem, known as presenteeism, and how costly it is to companies. When an employee has a set amount of work and has to fill a 40-hour week with it, there's no incentive to work efficiently beyond keeping it from taking more than 40 hours (and even that upper limit is questionable). The book also addresses the underhanded comments, such as \"nice of you to join us,\" which it calls \"Sludge.\" It explains that while on the surface and on an individual basis, these comments seem harmless, but not only do they add up, they are also designed to keep us \"in line\" with the corporate culture of clock watching.\nThink about it, how often have you or someone you know called in sick, just so you didn't have to explain to your boss about the accident on your primary route? Or how about making a \"socially acceptable\" excuse because you had a hard time sleeping the night before and didn't want to get out of bed? Or any other number of stories you've lined up to tell your boss or coworkers for whatever reason why you were late coming in or early to leave or didn't make it in at all? How often have you feared that you'd be looked down on even if your real reason is a \"socially acceptable\" reason for missing or shortening your day? How many times have you come into work sick, or felt guilty about staying home when sick? These are all a result of Sludge and the corporate clock-watching culture.\nROWE, however, asks \"why does the clock matter so much? The work itself is what matters,\" and that's the basis for ROWE \u0026mdash; it doesn't matter how, when, or where the work gets done, as long as it gets done (assuming, of course, the means are legal and the work is done before any applicable deadlines). Does it really matter if Sally chooses to do her work in a coffee shop from 5pm to 2am, or that Dave does his from 6am to 11am at home, then some more from 3pm to 6pm at the park? If the work is getting done and is up to standards, then the answer is simple, it doesn't matter.\nOne of the best parts about the ROWE concept is that it's not just theory, it's in practice in Fortune 500 and Fortune 100 companies, as well as others. ROWE is already working for these companies, and these success stories provide leverage for implementing the system in even more companies. Taking a more creative look at the concept, on an individual level, working in a ROWE is not unlike working as a freelancer, except that a ROWE employee has the stability of an established company.\nIn all, Work Sucks is a must-read for anyone who knows that there must be a better way, as well as those who feel that the way things are is good enough (in other words, everyone in any kind of corporate environment). Even if your company can't fully implement a true ROWE, it can probably make use of a lot of the advice it offers.\n","date":"May 16, 2010","description":"","permalink":"http://shaunagordon.com/2010/05/16/review-why-work-sucks-and-how-to-fix-it/","series":null,"subtitle":null,"tags":["review"],"title":"Review: Why Work Sucks (And How to Fix It)"}]
